So if an adult loves a child that is OK? So if an adult loves an animal is that OK? we are normalizing perversion and it’s wrong!  These poor children are very influenced by what is around them.  I think this is so wrong in so many different ways!,1

"“‘Do not have sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman; that is detestable.” Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.” - The Bible   I pray that you guys revive the blessing of the Lord, and that you may realize the truth on this matter.",1

"The fact that in 2022, there are some ""grown ups"" that actually agree with a then 12 year old Lucas' stupid mentality(even though he supports LGBTQ now and retracts his statements as an adult), using stupid terms they think are cool, seriously reveal so much about their failure of parents, their ethics, their mentality, their bacteria infected brains which has reduced to their mental age to 12 as well.

I love the fact that the one kid that didn’t support it honestly didn’t know why.,0
The reason they dont have “Can you feel my heart” playing whenever lucas speaks just baffles me,0
Why would they let kids react to this,0
I love how they react but I'm bisexual,0

The fact that I think these kids are young- then I read the date and realize I was younger than that very young 5 year old at the time 🤣,0

Why do they support this it is super wrong,0
I remember viciously hiding my femininity as a young child and denying any sort of signs of being girly or liking things that might make me seem different .  Seeing Lucas react to this makes me so sad. Because I’ve been him trying to save face for my parents or denying myself my true feelings in hopes I could fix myself . Im very happy Lucas moved on to Makeup and Black Pink .,0

Like Lucas, he had so strong feelings about why it was wrong, but when they asked why he thought that, he simply just said ""I don’t know"". Young kids that think like that, it’s usually not their own thought, especially when they don’t even know why they think so. All I’m saying is, influence.",0
Lucas was awesome. That is a genually response with no filters. There still is faith in Humanity.,0

Message: Sometimes don't hate on people who don't support the lgtbq+ community its something part of they're own religion and they can't change it and I had a friend who doesn't support it it's because of they're religion please respect some people thank you,1
People aren't born lgtbq they grow up to be lgtbq from lgtbq teachings in school that is the reason why lgtbq actually why lgtbq is growing if you keep a child away from school and also making lgtbq  most places there religion dosent condone it and making lgtbq teachings in school is like giving up a native religion like if you agree,1

I am a big fan of dhar man but I had to dislike this video. I'm 12years of age. I am an seventh day Adventist. I'm not saying that we should treat gay people indifferent and any less than us but God made man to go to a woman not woman to woman and man to man I'm not trying to be disrespectful but. With the thing we as a people should try reaching out to these people and help them get over the problem of being gay it should be stopped. It is wrong because God did not made life for his people to be gay,1

Watching this brought back the exact same hurt I felt in high school when this happened to me. I wasn’t a masculine kid rather very slim and female looking. I hadn’t reached my growth spur yet. My voice was soft and some even said I had feminine tendencies. All I knew is I loved baseball and wanted to play. I remember the coaches son on my little league summer camp team being very aggressive to me because of my looks. Coach had to verbally discipline his own son many times for his outbursts towards me. There were times he aggressively threw a ball at me while I wasn’t looking. I thought growing up a bit and maturing in my looks would change things. In high school I decided to try out for the new baseball team. The first week of practices were great. Then the coach surprisingly pulls me into his office and says I couldn’t play because of my grades and conduct. I was baffled considering I was an honor roll student. I knew something was off. I asked him where did he get that information from. He remained dismissive and kept repeating my grades and conduct was keeping me from playing. It became clear to me I was being discriminated against because of something personal. I tried moving to the track team afterwards and realized he was the same coach over track. I was so hurt I spent the entire high school days retreating to myself. It wasn’t long before I was comfortable with being a loner. It was my immature way of protecting my heart. I didn’t really reach my growth spur until my late 30s. Aging for me took longer than some. During my twenties and early thirties it was evident I was being mistakenly viewed as homosexual because of my feminine like features. I failed miserably trying to get folk to look past my countenance and focus on my personality. It just didn’t come. I carried this anxiety through college and into the workplace. Colleagues would second guess everything I would do or say because of how I appeared to them. I recall mentioning my experience in accounting to a superior. His response was you definitely don’t look like you’re old enough to have completed that many years in accounting. When I revealed my age he still was reluctant to believe me. Watching this video is a stark reminder that this can happen to anyone. I pray this message reaches the heart of every viewer to go against the odds and give people a chance. You never know who you maybe stopping from being an impact to the future you.,0

Lets appreciate the fact that Dhar doesn't only make content of LGBTQ people and struggles during Pride Month. I'm glad he doesn't take advantage of Pride Month lol.,0
"my favorite part of this was that  none  of the other kids on the team cared. they where like, ""oh rainbow towel, nice"" and moved on",0
Why,0
"gay can not play🤓 , anyways stan BTS NEW ALBUM PROOF  -Also Slay",0

Gay Athletes! Never heard of it,1
Whether you make a team shouldn't me based on your sexuality  it should be  about how good you play. Now transgenders athletes are  different  they need to start their own  leagues.,1
Happy Pride Month,0
"The first time I seen this, when the Coach saw the rainbow towel and started yelling at him I couldn't watch the rest of the video. I'm sorry it's just when people speak homophobic things to the LGBTQ+ community I can barely watch I'd have to cover my ears.",0
I would love to kick that coach  in the  bulls,0

"9 8 2 It's a simple concept basic logic if life is not free why the hell would death be any cheaper it's not. So the question one may wonder is the spiritual cost to one's own soul and spirit for having lived and died to the lowest standards of quality for so many years now global pollution has diminished the quality of life to the point where today's people are living, dying and yielding the worst spiritual kickback that has ever been manifested since the beginning of life only getting worse.  The polar opposite extreme to that is today's people should be living and dying to the highest standards of quality which would make each and every moment physically, mentally, financially and spiritually beneficial.

This video doesn’t make sense because first of all the coach just cut him from the team the coach is supposed to trade him but because it’s the champion ship game he can’t do that also players can’t join the game after the first half,0

"It was so obvious 💀 I thought ""this must be tricky because it cannot be so easy to guess"". And then it was lol",0
instantly knew it was sierra cuz of her jeans lmao,0
i thought fs it was sam lmao,0
Didn't even watch the video. Paused and looked at everyone's body language in the beginning. Guessed who it was. Fast forwarded to the the final reveal. I was right. I mean c'mon? I wish these were less obvious lol. The woman who turned out to be the mole had remarkably different posture than everyone else.,0
two years later they all come out as lesbian,0
Why the f did I know it was her so damn fast??,0
I had a crush I watched a f a girl likes u 10 sines she did all of them……………………..I got my hopes up than I found out she was lesbian😭😭😭KARMA WHY!!!!!,0
As soon as they started talking abt nails and sierra said “i bite my nails” i was like Yep sierras the one,0
"I did suspect her, i dont know why i just felt it coming😭",0
"Sorry to say it's going to be pay day one day. Do not be deceived, God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows.

Isn’t Joey the lesbian? Lol I’m kidding.,0
"I HAVE AN AMAZING GAYDAR Litterally right as soon as I saw Sierra, I was like ""It's her"" It also could have been because she looked really anxious within the first ten seconds but-",0
My mind when straight to the tall blonde one with the green cropped shirt and dark jeans,0
I took one look at all of them and immediately found her,0
I knew it was Sierra from the moment I saw her,0
12:39 I KNEW IT!,0
rip off jubilee,0

I was a secret lesbian for 32 years. 😆,0

"I thought Sam was the lesbian, I watched their 'and i'm straight' introductions and skipped to the end tho, sooo...",0
"I knew it from the start, woah my gaydar 🫡💅",0
i knew it was her as soon as i heard her trying not to laugh saying “i’m straight”,0
 i have heard my calling ,0
ommggg I was right 💃,0
"OMG as a lesbian, the first time I saw Sierra I knew! I have a really great gaydar",0
omg I hate LA people …,0
"Wow, it's almost like lesbians don't stick to codes from The Walking Stereotype Handbook 🤦‍♀️😂",0
"i just read the title and i was like ""its me""",0
sierra was acting so straight that i thought she must be the lesbian bc its too much... but then she became so convincing i just ended up confused,0
I knew right from the start that it was  sierra... everything about her was off,0
i had my heart set that it was keeley 😂 would have never expected it to be who it was,0
I thought it was the girl in the orange dress,0
I am the secret Les,0
I THOUGHT IT WAS SAM FOR SUREEEEE,0
I KNEW IT ALL ALONGGGGGGG,0
Man I must be lesbian because I love Pinterest,0

Why did I know it was her?😂,0
Am lesbian,0
Sam looks like the type of str8 girl you’ll fall for but you realize you have no chance because she doesn’t have that kind of attraction to girls-,0
I have cut off jeans... I'm straight af.,0

She should be a actor,0
Omg I was so sure it was Hailey 😭,0

I have my nails done long and was a cheerleader and im bi but lesbian for my boo😭😂,0
Just realized I was not subed,0
Tbf half of them were giving closeted or bi vibes,0
The votes are all wrong. It was ME the whole timel I was the secret lesbian &gt;:O,0
At the beginning I thought that it would be Sam or Georgia,0
"When she says she never kiss a girl that's when my gaydar when off bc every girl has kissed a girl before, if they say otherwise they are lying.",0
I think shows like this make it clear that  stereo types aren't accurate and that you can't know someone's sexuality just by looks👁👄👁,0
I KNEW IT THE FIRST TIME SHE EVEN BREATHED,0
Women. It's WOMEN.,0
"typing this before seeing the end results, will edit comment after if i get it wrong. I am looking at Sierrah...I'm getting major lesbo vibes from the one in those lesbianish denims lmao its either one of the two blonde girls...who knows..  EDIT: I FUCKIN KNEW IT LMAOO ITS SIERRAH BRO I KNEW IT",0

"Lol I knew Sierra from the get she said ""check the nails"" lolol",0
Trick question I’m the lesbian,0
atp gaydar doesn't exist lmao,0
"Honestly the fact that Sierra was with her hands a her waist in the beginning just gave it away to me lol, straight woman are always trying to occupy the least space possible",0
So much for female intuition,0
"I wish it had been keely, she's so fine.",0
"I KNEW IT, but sam was confusing me a bit too",0
"it’s a straight or bi girl thing to be kissin ur friends while drunk, usually bi lmaooo (/hj)",0
It’s giving jubilee,0
I think she did a LOT of research and preparation lmao,0
"Man she got us good, sierra was the last one I expected…",0
Genuinely shocked I got it right,0

OMG PETER PAN 2003,0
I sussed her from the start us lesbians think alike,0
I knew it from the start 💀,0
"as a bi girl, i know i just would mess up since my gaydar on girls never works",0
My gaydar let me down. I thought it was Keeley at first 😂 But then I ruled her out and went with Sierra. I've been failed.,0
I just watched the intro and I knew Sierra was the one qindiwnd,0
my gaydar sences were tingfeling i knew itt HAA,0
"0:26 I knew it was her because of the starting pose 😂 It was even clearer when a second later I saw the difference with Sam: same pose, different vibes 😂😂😂",0
I guessed who it was straight away just because she had her hands on her hips,0
I'm lessbyin!😍😘😍😘😍😘😍😘,0
Sam  I’m single I have a boyfriend  I’ve never dated,0
"as a lesbian, i knew it was sierra right away, but if u look at her body language it did look like she was hiding something, she always had her hands hidden",0
My gaydar sucks 😭,0
What’s the point of voting if only Joey votes count,0
"My first guess was Sierra because she knew the specific spots to check, like observing nails and shoes. But then I changed my guesses many times hahah so fun",0
"Since i first saw her i knew she was, but at last minute i changed my opinion but i was right the whole vid😫",0
Damn I literally guessed it  straight  away,0
Some of the other girls were giving lowkey homophobic... anyway I could tell as soon as I saw her reaction to everyone having kissed a girl,0
I secretly wish it was Sam😅,0
nobody caught when sierra said 'femme' lmao that gave it away,0
"I’d just say I’m bi, it’d be a lot harder to figure me out then (if hypothetically I was the lesbian, but I’m pan 💅)",0
"why’d i guess it from the thumbnail, i looked at her and i was looking closely and thought “i can sense that’s a lesbian”",0
I didn’t even watch the video.  I looked at the cover and guessed right.,0
Spoiler it’s all,0
I like Sams style shes cool.,0
Steve and Billy &lt;3,0
I knew it 😂,0
I knew it!! I got it right 😝,0
That was my first guess. But then I guessed like seven people.,0
"As a lesbian, my gaydar needs fixing, I genuinely thought Keelie was lesbian, SHE JUST GIVES THE VIBES YKWIM",0
keeley and georgia,0
For me when I saw Sierra I was like she’s either the most wholesome ally or the soft lesbian we all need in our lives,0
All lesbians with nails be like 👁️👄👁️,0
Sam just tell the truth do you have a boyfriend or not?,0
theyre all fruity,0
straight women kissing and making out with women will always continue to baffle me,0
I CALLED IT,0
At exactly 1:46 into the video I do the exact same thing my nails are really short 😂,0
I picked her out first question Idk im just that good at picking out lesbians ..she really gave her self away when she said  reversing turns her on lmao,0
fish?,0
Okay I’m a lesbian I’m not very feminine but some of the stereotypes are kind of offensive,0
"Was it weird I knew from the voice? Right at the beginning, when they said their name and they were straight.",0
me:  skips to end of video ,0
I spotted her from the start lmao,0
Thought it was Georgia 😃😃 good one,0
I knew she was since she asks all the questions,0
I literally just looked at her and felt the vibes. I didn't think my gaydar was this good slkdfjdsof,0
Stop she was my last vote bruh she acted so straight,0
"Omg, Sierra was the one person I did not expect it to be. I thought it would be the perfect, straight cheerleader girl cause she just had that vibe. 😭",0
I wanna see Pansexuals,0
omg i need to be on here,0
I knew it 😭😭😭,0
"omg sam, wanted to punch her the whole god damn video",0
"Me, I’m the secret lesbian.",0
Yo I was right!!!,0
"i looked at sierra and ""hMMMMMMM LESBIANA""",0
I WAS SHOOK BY THE RESULTS I REALLY THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE GEORGIA,0
Why are u coping jubilee,0
her outfit looks like she was trying to look as straight as possible so I felt like it was her right away,0
i knew it i littelary knew the straught looking will be the lesbian,0
I cant help i hate sam sm,0
i thought it was sam😶‍🌫😶,0
"bahaah im lesbian (well bi) and im sitting here ina fur coat, ripped jeans short short top, just took my heals of with a full face of makeup that took half hour, im 13 and yea",0
"2:40 ""i get good grades, i go to church, im a CHEERLEADER"" lmao",0
This one i could win,0
"as a femme lesbian, it's so funny to hear these straight girls think nails and heels are for straight people and ""edginess"" and boots are OOP YOU A LESBIAN  I love my nails and heels  and boots, ok you got me",0
Who else thought this was CUT till the video ended😅,0
Ok lmao check all of the instas… one of them has 🏳️‍🌈 lmao,0
im shocked-my gaydar broke tf.,0
WHY WAS MY GAYDAR SO OFF. IM MEANT TO KNOW THIS,0
"I've always prided myself for my gaydar, and once again, I was right. I guessed Sierra from the very start.",0
YALL MY GAYDAR WAS ON POINT FROM THE GET GO 💅✨,0
"I was looking for the girl who spoke the fastest, and sierra spoke very fast at the beginning, so I feel proud rn.",0
no because i thought it was sierra from the beginning 💀💀,0
I knew before they even started.,0
This was the best one I’ve seen yet! 🙌🏼🤣,0
Ur pfp looks like Simon from americas got talent I love you,0
I'm laughing because I guessed it when she wrote with her left hand lmao. Idek why that made me think she was the lesbian because I (very much a lesbian) am right handed lmao,0
I knew it the second I saw her 😈,0
my gayometer was so right 💋,0
"As a lesbian, I have never been so disappointed in my gaydar 😭",0
i thought it was joey.... oops,0
"I did kind of expect it to be Sierra, the eyeliner really gave it away for me haha",0
She was my first guess 😂😂😂,0
brb yall- i need to go to fix my gaydar rq,0
I could tell it was Sierra from pretty much the start because she was the only one who looked visibly uncomfortable throughout most of the video.,0
i honestly thought it was hailey lol,0
I actually got it right. It was the jeans and the white shoes that sold it for me. 😂 I have the same outfit 🙃,0
Ngl my vote went to the woman I hoped was lesbian.,0
"As a sapphic, i audibly gasped at the reveal. Did not expect that at all honestly 😭",0
2:48,0
Im a lesbian and i got it right away ig its just easy to spot them now WE LOVE TO SEE IT HUNNY,0
People would be voted me straight away sporty and not at all girly,0
"every other girl in the rooms are ally, unless..",0
Bro I knew since the beginning I was like She’s the moll right in the beginning,0
"When she said ""maybe the chance will come"" for kissing a girl I was like: damn don't get too excited. Which then convinced myself from that joke that it's her and I was right-",0
"Okok so I, Pan certified 😎💥🔥, saw a vid like this and guessed right for that one, so I decided to test my gaydar again! I guessed Sierra after looking at only the intro so it would really be only gaydar and was surprised to get it right again!",0
"I knew from the start that sierra was the lesbian, her fit really looked like she was playing pretend straight since literary she looks like she came out of 2019 pinterest",0
This just proves my theory: stereotypes are never entirely sufficient to determine one's orientation. 😏😏😏,0
"I'm lesbian and I didn't feel identified with any of the stereotipes they said... sooo, Idk...",0
What's wrong with my belt 😡,0
as a lesbian i hated everything about this video,0
bro i swear it was sam,0
my first question would be asking what they listen to and what they watch also if they are a crystal lady or obsessed with zodiac signs,0
I LOVE RIVERDALE AND JUGHEADDDD,0
Her whole life throughout the video stand out more than the others,0
I knew it was sierra,0
What’s the point of them voting if Joeys vote out votes them.?,0

"I honestly don't know how but I knew it was her the whole time, it was just a feeling I guess",0
she was like one of the straightest dressed girls too like I thought that maybe she was throwing everyone off but i didnt know 😭,0
"As a Lesbian, they pribably don't mean it but they're giing off stereotypes. Like  I am one of the most girly people you'll meet and like girly stuff, so now I'm straight?",0
love haily's dress hate her shoes,0
I clicked faster than a lesbian going to end of the year Subaru sale,0
"""But I'm a Cheerleader""",0
Littt💥💥💜💜,0
As a lesbian I called it within first few minutes. It's the vibe they put off! You can just tell,0
I thought that this would be easy as a lesbian but no I'm just watching this with full confusion,0
Samantha looks so spankable uff,0
I knew instantly from the thumbnail💀💀 it’s her outfit colours,0
sierra was too confrentational at the beggining and quiet at the end it was obvious,0
"I KNEW IT, MY LESBIANISM KNEW SIERRA WAS LESBIAN.",0
"the second she corrected joey by saying ""femme"" when he said something about a pretty lesbian, i knew it",0
i think as a lesbian I learned that I shouldn't judge off appearance,0
"no one said ""sadly i'm straight"" I would've believed them right away",0
It's the flamboyant homosexual who's a lesbian transwoman.,0
I thought it was the girl in the orange dress because she reminds me of Leslie gore.,0
Whhhhhaaaaa what. My gaydar steered me wrong today🤣 like the last person I thought it could be. Definitely thought it was Keeley but probably just wishful thinking more than anything 😂,0
I always thought Pinterest was a straight giveaway lol,0
The material girl was just amazing-😭,0
Yea haha I also have not kissed a girl before yet. I am 22.,0
Sam seemed like a jerck,0
I knew immediately it was sierra when she. Freaked about not kissing girls,0
Fr Jubilee vibes,0
Me:  they’re all lesbian they’re all lesbian THEY’RE ALL LESBIAN ,0
Sierra and Hailey seem like they'd be such good friendsss,0
I knew based on the intro and the outfit,0
…I forgot that there are other people named Keeley other than me,0
"SAM, MY GIRL?   YOU SAID YOU WERE A SINGLE LADY, THEN HAD A RELATIONSHIP FOR 1 1/2 YEARS AND THEN 2 1/2 YEARS!? BISH",0
Does sam have ig?,0
My gaydar knew it at first sight,0
So basically trust the nails 💅✨,0
im a lesbian who gets my nails done 😭,0
Who else checked for cuffed jeans…..,0
I knew it was her!,0
For some reason I knew it since the beginning I was like “THIS ONE. she’s a lesbian 100%.”,0
No one can act straight better than a real lesbian🤣🤣🤣,0
Wait…. Joey: isn’t Pinterest a lesbian thing? Me: I SAW PINTREST ON MY MOMS PHONE!!!😱😱😱,0
I thought it was sierra or sam 😂,0
STOP SHE PLAYED THAT OFF A LITTLE TOO WELL SHE HAD ME WANTING TO PUNCH HER IN THE FACE-,0
The mole was so believable!! I didn’t guess her either 😅,0
my gaydar worked :),0
"As a lesbian, not surprised that the lesbian was the one who hadn't kissed a girl at a party. Straight girls are wild and y'all get more action than we do.",0
I knew it! sussed her from the start!!,0
bro  i was so confident that it was sam,0
My gaydar did me well in this one 😌,0
Spoiler.. its me,0
PETER PAN our childhood hottie,0
Lol she was the one I was like ... ur to good..😂,0
i knew it immediately. idk how but i did,0
"As a straight man, I am proud to say that I somehow got this right",0
My gaydar was off the roof I knew Sierra since the second that the video played,0
"I pray these people will read a Bible and find the lord, for he says a man and a woman should be together. I don’t believe people should just be okay with liking boys and girls",1
Sierra looked like she tried to dress overly straight girl so guess my gaydar works well ig lol,0
All of the other people yeah we’ve kissed girls before Sam and Sam in her mind I wish,0
I'm actually so proud of my gaydar for getting it right lol,0
i was going for sam but i think i just had a crush on her,0
I could've sworn it was Sam😶,0
I love everyone here,0
I love these videos I literally never expected her to be the mole I was so off,0
"WHEN SHE SAID THE REVERSE THING I WAS LIKE, THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE",0
I got it at the backing up lol,0
As a lesbian I was so excited when they said check the nails because my nails are so short,0
pov: u skipped to the end just to see who it was 😂😂,0
I had a kindergarten bf and omg crazy lol 😝,0
I knew it from the start,0
I really thought it was Sam,0
STOP I WAS RIGHT,0
7:21 And the OSCAR goes to…,0
"My gaydar was absolutely correct, feeling proud of myself being able to guess correctly from the start🙈☺️",0
Sam was so suspisus when she said she thought it was try and find the straight person,0
"i was right lmao, she has ""i listen to girl in red and clairo"" idk-💀",0
I knew it was Sierra &gt;:},0
as a sapphic I took one look at the thumbnail and immediately knew who it was,0
OMG I was so wrong. I thought it was Georgia and Sierra was my last choice. Lol.,0
2:47 i was a cheerleader and a back spot and i’m not straight,0
"Ironically, everyone had trouble with the box at first.",0
Bro what,0
I guessed at first it was sierra but I got guilty when she talked about her nails and just said it's probably sam,0
Okay guys hear me out with Georgia…🤭,0
Guessed it,0
YO I KNEW IT WAS HER,0
"I was thinking about coming out to my friend as bi, and I think it would be really funny to send a screenshot of the thumbnail for a video like this about bisexuals lololol",0
As a str8 person I also thought it was keeley,0
Ya know I was sure it wasn’t Sierra and then closer to the end of the video I caught her looking at miss orange dresses 🍒 - that was the moment I knew,0
giving me a jubilee vibe,0
lesbians always win,0
i thought it was sam bro,0
Mfs names jake: 😱❤️,0
She answered about peen based on research not experience so that done it for me,0
POV your a homophobic watching this,0
i literally guessed it was her before the video even started… how did they not get it??,0
❤️❤️❤️❤️,0
"I was secretly hoping it’s Georgia, she’s gorgeous. ❤️😩",0
need more representation in these videos :(,0
MY GAYDAR WAS RIGHT!!!,0
Wait Peter Pan in the live action was my first crush too….,0
"me, i was the lesbian",0
I flipping knew ittt,0
"these are so hard bc you second guess yourself so much, but sierra literally just. they look like a lesbian. most of my white lesbian friends look exactly like sierra",0
love the vids,0
I did not think it was sierra AT ALL,0
I’m guessing keley,0
"why's everyone so shocked, I think it was very obvious....????",0
as soon as they did their intruductions i knew and i guessed right 😭,0
Easy…look for the lesbian eye brows  👁,0
As a bisexual person I knew who it was from the start😌,0
I knew it! She didn't look very excited when she said that she'd be straight,0
Just as expected,0
I GUESSED IT RIGHT IN THE BEGINNING YESSIR I KNEW IT,0
I could tell on the first round and I could tell immediately so I’m proud that I’ve put my gaydar to use,0
I thought my headphones broke at the start-,0
I'ma lesbian and still I cherr,0
I knew it!!!!!,0
I took one look at sierra and went “it’s her”  😂,0
"You know the lesbian would win, they pretend to be straight :) (haven’t watched the vid and I’m pansexual so no hate to lesbians)",0
9:42 This brought back a memory I forgot I had💀,0
That was unexpected!,0
"When she says ""my nails are really short cuz i bite them"" i already had my suspicions cuz i do them too lol",0
I’m a lesbian and I just knew it was gonna be her hha,0
Oml I knew it. She was so awkward with all the questions about what you like most about guys and stuff. And then she get really nervous with the kissing girls stuff😂😂,0
I knew it was her when she acted shocked that girls were kissing each other,0
"When I saw her hands on her hips, confident, and the other girls were all arms to the side or behind them- I Suspected sierra. Then she only had online references for the “ length or girth” question, where the others had an answer.",0
Bruv I knew it as soon as I clicked on the video! Like her outfit = 🏳️‍🌈,0
From first second,0
I knew it:),0
Do you know gem? Cuz she’s bi✨,0
I thought it was her when she introduced herself but I KNEW it was her when I saw her stance while they were all lined up 😂. IYKYK,0
i got it as soon as she intoduced herself. proud of my gaydar,0
I looked at all of them(in the thumbnail) felt a vibe clicked on the video skipped everything till the reveal and I was right🤣,0
I knew it already from the beginning 😂😎,0
I had doubts with the person whos wearin a frickin dress...,0
"I have a great gaydar, but she gave me so many straight vibes 🤣💀",0
"I dont think anybody caught how the blonde and blue eyed girl said ""Yeah there were like three lesbian cheerleaders"" And then the guy said ""Are the other two your lesbian friends? and she didnt point out how she had said three and not two",0
based off of nothing i’ve been on this like a minute i think it’s sierra i won’t delete it if it’s wrong,0
I was shocked 😭 I’m not tryna be mean but she seemed like very basic white girl from tiktok,0
wow she sooooold that,0
"I knew it was sierra as soon as she opened her mouth, perks of being very observant of others lol.",0
"first I thought it was Sam, but then the pants and then with length vs width question i got to the conclusion she's def straight, and my second option was sierra bc of how confused she was about the girls kissing girls in party and the jeans lmao",0
sam seemed so confused the entire time,0
"I knew it was Sierra within the first two minutes.  However, I kept doubting my pick every time Sam lied.  But I never switched.",0
joey in his jubilee era,0
As soon as Sierra said she had never kissed a girl I was like hmmmm. I was so happy when I got it right :DDDD,0
Damn she was such a good actress,0
what’s wrong with my belt,0
I already Thought in the beginning that she was it lol,0
I forsure thought it was Sam. Her answers were all over the place.,0
I wheezed at “material girl”,0
As soon as she came in and said she was straight I could tell she was lying LOL,0
I was shocked 😂 I think I was wishfully thinking it was Georgia ❤️ haha,0
why did i think it was the girl in the dress the entire time-  she had a vibe yk,0
"If a lesbian has long nails, that means shes single, not that she's straight",0
i think it's the first time i actually guessed right from the very beginning,0
‘can we vote for joey’ HAHAH,0
I had a feeling it was her tbh,0
i literally knew it all along,0
"“mom can we have jubilee?” “no honey, we have jubilee at home” the jubilee at home:",0
Haven't even watched the full video but the guy in the back sounds like David Alverez,0
I literally started the video picked the girl in the green shirt and I got it right 😌,0
Sam pissing me off haha,0
I just wanted it to be Georgia because I think she’s the prettiest 💀,0
JACK ACTUALLY WAS JANE!,0
still dont get how cuffed jeans means youre not straight. it annoys me sm.,0
no bc i was SURE it was kaylee,0
"as soon as sierra came on screen in the introduction i was like ""its her. i can sense it.""",0
I KNEW ITTTTTTTTT AHHHHHH 😱,0
"I mean technically we are all wrong , Joey isn’t a lesbian ..",0
"When sierra said the reverse thing I knew it was a lie, she just saw it on TikTok and copied it",0
I Knew from the Moment i Saw Sierra she was the lesbian,0
"I knew it was Sierra, it was the outfit that seemed the most fruity compared to everyone else’s. But I have to admit that her acting skills were really good, I almost changed my mind.",0
me im the secret lesbian,0
Can anyone give me advice I’m really confused about my sexuality I don’t know if I’m Bi Or A Lesbian can you tell me signs of each because I’m kind of attracted to men but I’m really attracted to women what should I do,0
Wtf I was soo sure that it would be Georgia🥲,0
"I was secretly hoping it's Georgia, she's gorgeous.♥️😩",0
"I feel like because Sam came there thinking she was the straight girl among lesbians,  she came there ready to play. She knew all the Lesbian stereotypes... she never heard of ""fish in men's dating photos"", even as a lesbian... I'm aware. Cracked me up",0
Aren't these Vote Videos very sexist ?,0
I thought they all lesbians,0
I guessed it was her from the beginning because she gave off vibes like me. Never been right before,0
All the straight girls were super homophobic and i am so happy their homophobic stereotypes made them lose,0
Bro sierra was hilarious,0
Chica meterial 😆,0
some of those are bullies fr,0
I knew it was sierra from the BEGINNING OMG !!,0
Keeley reminds me of Sarah Paxton in Aquamarine lol,0
"I was right yesss, my gayradar finally worked",0
I never guess who's not straight but c'mon it was so obvious 👀,0
I knew it was sierra froom the beginning cuz her shirt was too cottage core,0
I was so sure it was going to be Georgia,0
I knew it she was asking so many questions and she was so suspicious,0
Sam was making me mad 😭,0
Nooooo i knew itttttt,0
I haven’t watched the hole video but I skipted to the reveal and I was right😎,0
"my gaydar always on point. i didn’t even watch the vid, skipped to the end and i was right😭",0
Love this video,0
God I was off...,0
I've been fooled. I thought Georgia's enthusiasm about peen was try hard. 😭,0
I knew it was her because I am a lesbian too and she did a lot of things that I do,0
I would be lesbian for sam lol,0
"Picked it from the beginning, gotta test the ""gaydar""",0
cuffed jeans arent even a lesbian thing LOL,0
"Should have known when she couldn't answer the length or girth question!   Also the driving part, she probably likes with girls which I do as well...",0
no i guessed sierra a little only cause she said “fem?” lmfaoo,0
So there's five girls and one guy but only the guy's opinion matter or did i just got it wrong?,0
I WAS SO CERTAIN IT WASNT HER WHAT,0
Sams kinda rude.,0
i freaking knew it,0
Imagine liking boys,0
I cant wait.Who's lesbian?,0
As soon as they walked out I knew who it was!,0
i guessed right. As soon as she put her hands on her hips i knew. Laughs in bisexual,0
Its been less than a minute and here’s my guess: Georgia   (I’ll edit my reaction when im done with the vid)  Edit: .0. She was my 2nd choice because of her pants!!!! (And other stuff but what evvvv),0
Why do some people sound so insulted that they’re thought to be lesbians 😭,0
I guessed her at the beginning of the video,0
Okay I’m lesbian and I was a cheerleader I also have long nails,0
"Damn, I thought it was Joey.",0
All so beautiful,0
To be fair Keeley was so nervous and awkward like in her mind it was saying “I’m not supposed to be here I stick out like a sore thumb” so I fully understand why Joey thought it was her because so did I😂,0
"As a lesbian I thought for sure it was Hailey, I was shook it was Sierra",0
"Joey, I’m living for these! It’s nice to see you out of the house amongst the living. Not that seeing you with your dogs and puppies everyday wasn’t the best. Love you, Joey and your Team 💛🧡",0
wth i did NOT see that coming,0
the girl in the dress reminds me of a sim,0
THE REVERSE THING I DID IR,0
a nightmare,0
I heard David lollll I knew he was behind this,0
I thought it was keeley bc nobody else said they had a bf and if ur trying to seem straight you’d say that but ig I was wrong💀,0
I don’t like how they judge ..,0
Fem lesbians???,0
wow that was a curveball i didn’t expect her to be lesbian!,0
“can we vote for joey”,0
“i didn’t know what segment we were in”,0
the girl who forgot to mention her boyfriend😭,0
this was so fun!!!!,0
this made me feel smart as soon as she insisted her nails were short bc she bit them i was like “it’s her”,0
"When i saw some cuffed jeans my gaydar stayed low but when i heard u have a boyfriend, my gaydar went THROUGH THE ROOF",0
Once she mentioned theatre I knew it was her. I’m in theatre and there’s like no straights there.,0
I knew it was sierra because I followed her on tik tok,0
CUFFED JESNS ???????? Bro I do mine every day very straight I’m annoyed they weren’t talking abt life experience and stereotyping,0
I knew it.... I'm Sooooo right.!,0
"As soon as she came out to be the only one who hadn't kissed a girl yet, I knew it was her lmao",0
Does anyone know what keelys Jean are called,0
isn’t this a direct rip off of jubilee videos?,0
The whole video I knew. I dunno why but I just knew.,0
low key sam was getting on my nerves,0
My immediate gut reaction was either Sierra or Georgia. My gaydar does not lie,0
I THOUGHT IT WAS KEELEY TOO 💀,0
I knew it was her the minute she said she’d never kissed a girl lolll,0
"""isn't Pinterest a lesbian thing"" my mum using pinterest every single day",0
They are all soooo drop dead gorgeous,0
MAN SHE PLAYED IT SO WELL  I WOULD HAVE NEVER GUESSED HER,0

"i have never known any straight man to have a fish, im canadian, maybe its an americian thing",0
I am the secret lesbian🙈🙋‍♀️,0
i thought it was sam the whole time,0
i’m a lesbian and i had no idea who it was lol well done,0

Why is this popping up now?,0
high on painkillers.,0
"I came out as bisexual to my family, i wasnt accepted by my parents. But through my parents not liking me as much because of me being bi, my siblings were always there for me and eventually i found my girlfriend, me and her have been together for 4 years now, so no matter what people or social media says, you can be whoever you are, because its your life, and your choice.",0
Thank you Shane. This helped me so fucking much. Thank you,0
even if you are gay I still support you.,1
"John 3:16 “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”",1
"I absolutely LOVE YOU SHANE!!!!! I’ve been watching your Channel for awhile now, and am so glad I came across this video. Even though it was 6 years ago, this video is amazing, and I just love how you said do it and told the world exactly how you feel and what it is and who the fuck you are whether you knew it or not! You’re just an amazing, AMAZING SOUL 🤍 Wish I knew you in person 🥺 Love you to pieces 🥰😘🤍 Xoxo 💋",0
"I appreciate this video as someone who is bi. I never watched your channel, but I love this and even after 6 yrs it’s lasted where ppl like me need it. So thank you &lt;3",0
I have honestly never been so related to what your saying Shane literally 💖 thank you💖🦋,0
You have my super luv &lt;3,0
I not rude or anything but I don't like gays,1
trisexual. Men women and cats haha,1
sometimes when things get hard I always come back to this video. thank you for helping me be comfortable with my sexuality. forever looking up to you and how you were and are never afraid to be who you are &lt;3,0
You remind me of an x of mine. We are like 50 now. I think of how he would have been great at what you're doing but instead he got bullied to the point he barely left the house for his gayness. We had a blast just hanging out at his moms. I'm so glad we are past all that in society today.,0
"I'm so so sorry your families religious beliefs made you feel that way shane, you're amazing you YOU SIR SHANE YAW yes I'm using your given name because YOU are absolutely 💯 % A M A Z I N G! I hope you genuinely know how much you have helped so so many people.im so happy you're your true self and happy with Ryland. He is the other have of your coin.",0
So proud of u shane sometimes i think im bi too but i dont know honestly,0
KING,0
"I am so glad your not doing YouTube anymore. LGBTQ is fine but after what you did, you don't deserve your fans. They are above you. So many children look up to you, not knowing how many bad things you have done",0
Just focus on youtube. Keep your personal issue to your self.,0
I love this song sm,0

🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈,0
Hey what’s up you guys yes,0
It's ok... people should judge by soul and not sexuality,0
Ew,0
"I'm watching this 7 years in the future.....and you are still proud to say you are bisexual, even though you are in a relationship with a man. Keep being true to yourself.",0
!!!!!!!!!!HII FROM 2021!!!!!!!!!!,0
Uh oh no child is safe,0
"Okay, really late to this Shane party. Its 2021 for fucksakes why am I just discovering how AWESOMELY TALENTED you are?? I believeyour sexuality is YOURS. You dont have any obligation to make excuses or justifications to anyone, but yourself. As long as its consensual with all parties involved that is) Anyone who judges you for your sexual preference isnt deserving of being in your life anyway. IMO, people like that can be their idea of ""sexually perfect"" by going &amp; fucking themselves til the end of time.  Anyway, I hope your still creating content because DAMN dude you are funny AF &amp; so talented. Ive read the many comments saying how happy you are &amp; hope it continues for you.THANKS for starting my day on a positive note!! Take Care, be YOU &amp; FUCK ANYBODY THAT THINKS OTHERWISE.💜",0
Why this on my feed 6 years after it posted?!,0

IM PANSEXUAL,0
I’ve watched this video so many times over the past 6 years. It’s not because I’m bi or gay. It’s because I LOVE seeing Shane be so real and open. I’ve been a fan since I was a kid and I miss him so much..,0
no one cares,0
Please don't fuck your cat,0
gay lol,1
We all know 👁👄👁,0
Nobody: Not a single soul: Me watching this in 2021,0
I’m looking for the comment on twitter 💀,0
Shane's the reason why I came out as bisexual. I owe everything to him because this video described everything I was thinking about myself. I repressed my feelings for years and I finally came out officially to myself and others this year. Thanks Shane for everything.,0
"It's 2021 and I'm watching this... Welp, I don't know how my life arrived here but I have no regrets.",0
His teddy bear shirt omg it’s so cute 😭,0
Thank you Shane! We love you.,0
"Coming out was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done. A year ago yesterday I was out to my “best friend” at the time (who after a couple weeks turned out to be my girlfriend) and she asked me if I liked anyone and I froze and kept giving off subtle hints that it was her and when she finally realized she hugged me and then took both my hands, pushed my hair behind my face and told me she loved me. Then we were holding hands every time we saw each other and we started cuddling but we weren’t official yet. After a couple weeks I didn’t care if it ruined our friendship and I asked her out. She was so excited and she said she’d love to be mine and it was great. We had our first kiss three weeks after we got together. Then my homophobic mother found out after I accidentally came out to my teacher and threatened to separate us. I cried for three days straight and even went down the terrible road of SH. I told her I couldn’t just be friends with her and that I actually loved her so so much. We decided to do anything we could to fight to be together after she found out I loved her. It was tough to hide things at first, but we eventually got really good at jumping off each other then cuddling and kissing after people left the room for 5 minutes. I was heavily sexualized even though I’m very young and my mom’s side of the family always assumed I would be the “weird” one and throw myself onto my girlfriend at the time. I never told them but they found out somehow. It was so draining to just not even be able to sit next to someone I love so much. We weren’t even allowed to hug around my moms side of the family. I loved and admired this girl so so much and I still to this day do. I don’t really want to get into all the details but we got into a little fight and she’s being forced to stay away from me because I apparently was taking her away from her family according to her parents which I don’t know how that can be possible if they always did whatever they could to get rid of her for as long as possible and they let us take her everywhere with us. It was almost like an unofficial custody thing. We got her on weekends and when things were tough in her home. But now I miss her more than life and she still talks to me in person. I know she misses me too just by the way she acts around me and my family. She’s just not allowed to have any contact outside of in public.",0
Little did 10 year old me watching this know that I was pan Damn man life hits like a bag a rock being chucked down a flight of stairs aimed for my head,0
"Man, you're gay from the start, everyone knew.",1
LOL,0

"Hang ib there Shawn! It is more important than anything to truly listen to what you really want. Regardless of what the world might say or make you think, that is the Key",0
"I’m not ever, going to tell my children.. that they can’t do.. or love.. who they need to love… ever… I love you Shane ❤️ I know this video is old but.. still ❤️",0
"My son is in his 30's and is still trying to find out who he is yet. I really wish you didn't have to go through a bunch of this stuff. I also wish that society today wasn't so toxic towards people.  I know you are loved, you have an amazing opportunity to embrace your life &amp; the amazing talent, creativity that's inside you. Plus it was in the 70's I came out as bisexual because I was tired of the stigma so many put up with because of narrow-mindedness. I embraced it! I used to joke that I had more options for a date on Friday night.  Now, I'm older... 60 is not far off. I'm not interested any longer in the physical aspect. Companionship is the heart of love. The physical is a nice bonus... but the heart knows what it wants. Trust it. Also, glad you found someone who makes you the best you that you can be. That's important. Someone who not only stands beside you, but also stands up for you. Someone who's there for you, loves you &amp; challenges you. Someone who'll find ways to help you reach goals together.  I only wish you could reclaim the confidence, purpose &amp; the 'in the zone' passion you did while working on the pallet &amp; documentary. You had a strong vibe of energy. The confidence was in your walk, your smile, the way you were on target when you were filming. That documentary, &amp; the JS one were phenomenal! Loved the editing work, the tracks, totally high-end work. Don't keep such talent hidden away - share it with the world! We need a more positive, better world, better angels view to fight the negativity, hate &amp; toxic poison in today's society. I think you could do it - you could show the contrast of how things have gotten f'd up &amp; how we can make it better.  No matter how toxic things have been - your music has still helped to heal - Maybe This Christmas. Your music has still touched people and made them feel better - SuperLuv. You need to embrace the good you did, the positive things &amp; be proud of them. (People are still listening to those songs... I've checked, they are still enjoying them. Tons want a remake with Ryland as the girl &amp; a number of others came up as the bullies. But the positives are in the thousands for it. You've still Singing Shane fans who want more music from you. Go figure!)  Take care, stay safe out there... live your best life, 'cause it's the only one you've got. Be a shooting star or a lazy river... but make sure the choice makes you happy.",0

"Shane was so inspiring and had a way to make me laugh when no one and nothing else could.  I miss this side of Shane. It hasn't been the same with him for the past few years and especially with all the youtube drama and the apologies. I miss going to youtube and watching a Jenna Marbles video every Wednesday/Thursday and I miss when Youtube was an escape from life, even if it were 20 minutes.",0
watching this bc i really do miss when i didnt know how bad of a person shane was and when this video was like a turning point for so many ppl  sigh,0

Wow really I am to 😌,0
Not me watching this in November of 2020,0
where did he get that bear t-shirt/sweatshirt? I wanna get it :),0
"I'm really confused about my sexuality.   Ever since 6th grade, I've been made fun of for doing something that could've been considered gay. I wore another guy's coat because I was freezing in the rain on a school trip. I don't understand why but it's made me so confused and made me question my own sexuality. It's just fucked with my brain so badly that I don't know what I am right now.   I know it may sound silly or stupid but I really don't know. I know I like girls but every so often, I get thoughts about guys and I have no idea what is happening to me.",0
The clicking of the tongue ugh.  Love U Shane though x,0
Thank you sooo much for making this video it really helpful thank you never stop making videos love you 😊,0
I feel embarrassed watching a man say this,0
I HATE bisexuals,1
Shane may think this video sucks. But Shane u have helped so many fucking people come out as LGBTQ+. Including me as bisexual. I think Shane dosnt knows how much he’s helped people whenever he does come back he will have tons of people behind him. Including me Shane if ur reading the I MOTHER FUCKING LOVE YOU SHANE. and don’t forget YOUR SHANE FUCKING DAWSON!!!!!,0
I love you so much shane and you are the most amazing person EVER!!!!! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 You desverse the hole world!,0
I watch this like evry year,0
We support you Shane. No matter what. I'm bisexual to,0
I though your name was shane,0
"Wow, hes a part of our community yet transphobic",0
Lisa what the fuck did you do to him,0
"I always knew it, I’m bi too btw also I just found out through another video and I looked this up to confirm it, I was an early fan in 2009 but i lost track of your new videos and basically I missed this one lol ✌🏼❤️",0
"I love u Shane, please know that we still stand by you, ur going through a hard time and we’re here with full support❤️❤️❤️",0
I still love you Shane. I don't believe I commented on your videos but I am now. Not Cool is still my favorite movie. I watched it yesterday and I realized how much I used to love it (and still do). I can't wait for you to come back,0
I'm bi but I haven't told my parents but I have told everybody else because I'm just too scared to because they are very religious and I'm just not as religious as they are,0
I'll always Love you always you just keep hanging in there buddy keep making videos keep making people laugh you hanging in there,0

No one:   Not a Person in this universe:   Me:  watches this in September 2020 ,0
didnt u sexualize and try to out dnp without knowing the amount of shit they were going through especially dealing with sexuality,0
"It's ok. I am also bi. It is hard to say to people, I know. It's VERY hard.",0
Everyone still loves you Shane 😀😀😀,0
This is just in my recommendations,0
I love you Shane,0
So the drama and shit that's going on fuck that I don't want anything to do with it I don't care and I'll always love shane he's loving and I love going back to these videos before shit went down  Edit: You have to see past the imperfections to see someone's true self Shane is a great example he might joke about his insecurities and joke that Ryland is going to leave him he's telling us information through comedy just bc he has a lot of money does not make him better than us and he knows that he likes drama and we all do for the most part but people say he's begging etc or whatever this comment has no point other than to open your eyes a little wider and look into what people have been through it doesn't excuse their actions but it helps us grow into better people,0
im confused. I need help :(,0
WoW racist playing the sympathy card over here.,0
how do i fugure out if im bisexual,0
Im gay too.,0
god i'd watch his videos to cheer up but now that Shane's gone.,0
❤💜💙,0
Who’s watching this is September 2020. When the Shane drama died down?!?,0
Hello from August 2020,0
Did anyone else this he was gay this whole time (I’m pan) LOVE YOU SHANE,0
That's is ok man and nothing will take that from me watching your video,0
Gay actually. Nice try Dawson.,1
We don't claim you in our community now that we've found out what you did :),0
this is such a rare and beautiful video!!  thank you,0
no wonder he made zepeto..,0
lub u,0
And here we are 5 years later dating Ryland,0
hes gay. thats why it never works with women for him lol.,1
"i honestly think that if shane hasn't already changed, we should still give him a chance. those video were so long ago, and the videos he made with his actual friends (garrett, drew, andrew, morgan, etc) we're completely fine and he seemed like he'd genuinely changed. (up until the documentary videos, at least.) forgive, but don't forget is basically what i'm saying.",0
Was this before he started dating Ryland?,0
15 mins of Shane doing ASMR,0
pov: u don't care if ppl are here after he got canceled or if they're in quarantine yet u still see comments saying that,0

"I fucking love Shane , idc who says shit about him he’s a fucking angel and I’m so happy for him and ryland. More power to you Shane!",0

"“Homosexual persons are called to chastity. By the virtues of self-mastery that teach them inner freedom, at times by the support of disinterested friendship, by prayer and sacramental grace, they can and should gradually and resolutely approach Christian perfection.” – Catechism of the Catholic Church, 3359.",1
I guess Shane was too dumb to realize that getting fat is the least effective way to become invisible,0
Hope you’re  happy,0
"Watch Amazing Atheist's ""I'm Bisexualer""",0
bisexuality doesnt include children shane ✨🧚‍♂️💫🦋💮,0
we been knew sis💅🏻,0
🤗😍,0
I think whatever the abuse was that Shane endured when he was young really messed up his head! He has to be very careful because the abused are statistically more often to become abusers! That is why these constant “jokes” about pedophilia may be deeply held issues that he doesn’t realize are not okay! I hope he gets SERIOUS mental health treatment and a life coach! I honestly wish him hope and healing!!,0
Watching after Shane starts reuploading his videos,0
Love you shane your awesome,0
bruh if ur gay it doesn't mean ur not ever confused either lol,0
He looked so much more handsome. 😢,0
Racist,0
To all you pussys being too scared to say they're gay NOBODY GIVES A FUCK as a gay I know for a fact nobody is gonna judge you and if they do there fucked is the head. Same goes for bisexual btw,0
This is one of the many things me and Shane relate too!,0
Idk why this made me jump I guess I was just suprised but it's fine that your bi 🙂 I still respect you,0
Like if being gay is straight up gay,0
We will love you forever😘😍😍😘😍😍😘😘😍😘,0
"I really need to say thank you😭😭 You have helped me through SOO much,I have recently come out and have been spending less time in my room in the dark,you always put I smile on my face       I FUCKING LOVE YOU!!😭❤️❤️😭😭❤️❤️😭❤️😭",0

fuck shane,0
Who’s watching this now and still supporting Shane Dawson ?,0
"Shane, God Bless your heart. I'm sorry you were so uncomfortable with who you are and allowing yourself to accept it. You should never be ashamed of how you feel or who you are inside or out. And, let me say that God does accept you. Don't let that bother you.",0
And now your engaged to a guy so I mean you could have said that 🤔,0
And now he’s engaged and losing his career I mean I hope not cuz he’s amazing but it seems that way 🤷🏻‍♀️,0
"Shane, you're attracted to the heart, I think you're pan, gender doesn't matter.",0
It's so funny when children are replying to every recent hate comment on this video,0

That's kinda gay.,0
why are you gae ?,0
A racist bisexual,0
Am I the only one who is watching this in July 2020,0
Why not have a threesome it’s always good if your bisexual. Then you can have both at the same time and have any man and woman you like. I am not gay or bisexual totally heterosexual so I prefer only one woman . I will never be gay or bisexual. I’m pretty sure I am happy that way.,1
Almost 5 years :’),0
I was today years old when I found out he wasn’t always gay,0
the fact that he was in the closet while he basically outed dan and phil is just ugh,0
2020 anyone???,0
I’m so sorry about everything your going through right now you made me laugh and we’re always there for me when I needed someone I love you it will get better ❤️,0
Can someone explain what happened with Shane and why people are being mean to him?,0
HE DELETED ALL HIW VIDEOS DNDHHDJR,0
Wtf...,0
he’s bisexual. he likes women and men. stop telling him to pick one of them.,0
who’s here after he deleted all his old videos and the only ones left are the lottery and this 😆,0
"My mind is telling me no, BUT MY BODY, MY BODYS TELLING ME YESS",0
"Aww poor Shane, don’t be sad we all love you",0
who is here to end this man’s career?,0
almost five years later. damn shane.,0
"Shane.. dunno if youll get this. I realise things are spiralling and you feel cornered  I realise what edgy humor you were trying.. it was fine.. now its not. I still love you. Still support you. 💜 keep yourself safe. Mentally, physically, spiritually. Take time. Step away.",0
I love you Shane❤️,0
this should b titled I’m a nonce,0
shanee i was rooting for uu bitchhh. u got urself into so much dramaaa. i miss the unproblematic you. 😭😭,0
HE DELETED ALL HIS VIDEOS NOOO OMG,0
Just the 2 videos left. Damn. Use to come here for pick me ups after a long hard day. All gone. No more humor. Sad,0
I miss your older type of content. It’s a shame people are too sensitive for it now,0
4 years later he’s getting cancelled 🤭🥵,0
who’s here after his dumbass got cancelled😼,0
Who is here after he deleted almost all his vids,0
😂,0
I love you shane ❤,0
I remember being done with men when I told a boy he was cute and he told the teacher on me in second grade.,0
Who is here after the incident?,0
Cancel Culture is alive and real and it's taking Shane down 👎🏽,0
"I've decided to spam this message so there's a chance he'll see it.  I miss you so much Shane. I'm so disappointed right now. I feel like I understand why you had you're humor and when I started watching I was 12 and suicidal. I had just started self harming literally and then found you. I'm disappointed and obviously the jokes weren't okay but I made it because of you, well and myself. Now it's my child who's been why I'm alive but you're the reason I made it through my teen years. I love you Shane Dawson. Be better please. I believe in you and this is so messy. I hope the best for you. This also made me smile a lot when it first came out. I watched your struggle for so long. I came out at around 12/13 as bisexual and I got a lot of shit from friends so this was amazing to see. I was hoping if I commented on a older video there was no new comments on that you might see this. I literally have been trying to get your attention since I started watching. I'll be 23 soon so this is my last attempt. You gotta know deep down inside how yo fix this. Whatever roll you played.",0
Who here cuz he deleted all of his old vids?,0
🥺,0
i miss you shane.,0
here july 2020 and damn everything is going downhill,0
can’t believe you deleted your offensive and triggering content after you lost monetization on your videos. you should’ve done this shit ages ago. too late shane.,0
#cancelled,0
Wow only two videos left on this channel,0
So I just come on here and they deleted practically all of his goddamn videos. Whatever happened to freedom of speech? This is getting very scary this is like Russia or something. Put every damn video Back on YouTube if you don't like him don't watch this is taking away our freedom. People are freaking out about their freedom being taken away about having to wear masks during a pandemic which is disgusting but now this is a serious infringement. He apologized a lot of comedians make crazy jokes and just because Patty went on there to say some gossip about James Charles and her not feeling supported and all this nonsense they're going to go ahead and just cancel. I want these videos back. YouTube is disgusting for doing this and as a matter of fact I hope he finds a different format. Maybe Netflix. YouTube is below Shane and they should be ashamed he made a fortune for everyone,0
yeet,0
Don’t feel sorry for him,0
I’m here for no reasons.... i’m just here whenever i feel confused...,0
shane literally deleted all his videos,0
You were part of my childhood! I can’t believe you deleted your old videos!!!! I just remembered you (because all the current drama) so sad...just wanted to revisit it,0
Ofc he left this one up cause he thinks a video of him coming out and talking about being sexually abused will soften the blow,0
no,0
F this dude lol,0
Who came to see what he deleted?,0
Youre done son,0
Your alsooo racist,0
mans deleted EVERYTHING?,0
Ok I was bi but now I’m a full lesbian,0
Bro I didn’t think he deleted all his videos,0
Watching in June 2020,0
"i wish he didnt have this whole ""im depressed and anxious i hate myself more than any of you"" vibe about him because im disgusted by his actions and content over the last few years being overhyped and sloppy at best but part of me still feels bad for him despite never really being a fan. idk i hope he just takes accountability for once i dont want him to do anything irrational or stupid just... acknowledge all of the shit you did this time. if it makes you uncomfortable, imagine how to people who looked up to you feel right now, especially with your silence",0
"Depression and anxiety isn’t an excuse to sexualize children, Shane.",0
Anyone watching cuz of how bad he got cancelled?,0
and to think that back then he was a pedo..😳,0
Epic,0
June 2020 anyone,0
He deleted everything but 2 videos?? Damn..,0
"I love u shane, u still have a lot of fans that care about you, dont read hate comments and dont let them get to u. also there is a reply i found i thought needed more attention &lt;3 no hate :)  the reply:   here’s the thing. He screws up, everyone demands that he addresses it. He addresses it, everyone demands an apology.  He apologizes, everyone says it’s not sincere and that he only apologized for getting caught.  People demand he hides the videos because theyre offensive. He hides them, and everyone says he’s trying to hide evidence. I won’t lie that Shane used to have bad taste in humor, but that was 10 years ago, and he has changed since then. A lot of these people could literally not even be please if Shane disappeared forever, and that really irks me because at this point the just want to be mad.  Ignoring a decade of growth in someone just so you can cancel them is kind of dumb.",0
all these positive comments didnt age well😂,0
Now you’re cancelled you weirdo,0
Love you Shane.,0
You know a cids old of its in your recommended section,0
Ok what's going on,0
💖Anyone here after hes been called out for the gross person he is✨,0
He deleted all his offensive videos which should have been done the first time he apologized lol.,0
In the mighty name of jesus may you   become straight,0
Ryland has entered the chat,0
Who was trying to find vids from Shane years ago from drama alert then post it on Twitter lol,0
Who’s watching this after he’s been cancelled in 2020,0
Geiii,0
You say how hard it is to come out yet sexualised and tried to out dan and Phil multiple times ?,0
who’s watching this after he deleted this whole account-,0
"please unprivate the rest of your old videos, they were so fucking funny, ugh.",0
"Awww man, I wanted to watch Shanaynays Christmas, but it is gone. 😭",0

"Damn* the quality was so bad back then, and the fact that it was 2015!",0
Who else got the presidential campaign ad?,0
This must be hard for you to get accepted  BECAUSE I BET THIS COMMUNITY HATES YOU,0
How come he didn’t leave the short film it gets worse,0
who’s here after the videos he deleted,0
Yeah you are also a racist and perverted dude 🌚,0
"Dont know what side to take.....on one hand, what he did in his past was not ok and should have never happened. But on the other hand, the videos of him that are coming out, are over 5 years ago and bringing up something from the past to make Shane look bad (even though he has changed) is also not ok. It's hard to see Shane go through this. But the person reading this comment.....just know....nobody is perfect. Of course the things he did 6+ years ago are completely unforgivable, but I feel like people saying ""put shane in prison"" is too far. And I dont think I'm the only one asking this when I say ""how come just now these videos are being brought up?"". But on an end note, nobody is perfect and I choose to stay nuteral......",0
Really? You clear your old account that got you to where you are and leave a few? Pathetic. Hiding your past isn’t gonna help anything.,0
nobody: literally not a soul: you: coming to this channel after seeing he deleted all of his content and reading this comment,0
Whos here when  he got Exposed?,0
Damn. One of two videos left. Ouch.  More are public again. Awesome!,0
This is one of two videos left on his channel now because of all the controversies in the past few days. It’s so sad to see it all gone but it’s for the best. I hope Shane is okay and survived through all of this 💓,0
Your looking at this video during the drama with Shane,0
damn thats pretty gay,0
goodbye,0

Umm 🤔  it’s June 2020. And I am now finding this ........Jesus,0
Nobody  Nobody at all Not a single soul  Everybody saying nobody lmfao,0
Watching this video got me to gain the courage to come out as bisexual and now I’m with the girl of my dreams 🥰🥰,0
I came out as bi last year and I kinda knew that I was never straight because it never felt right for me so fast forward to about a week after I knew I realized that I had a hug and I mean HUGEE crush on my best friend and my idiot self kissed her out of no where (were still best friends to this day we just dont talk about that awkward kiss) I haven't really came out to anyone (my mum doesn't believe me and my dads side of the family r homophobic 😬) so uh yeah thats me coming out 😂,0
"I remember watching this just weeks after coming out as Bi, this video of Shane coming out made me feel confident that I did the right thing. Hope ya see this Shane, I can tell you are so much happier since coming out, I have been too since I came out, Also one more thing, your conspiracy vids are my favorites from the new series.",0
"I'm also bisexual, have no qualms in saying it out loud, so no worries. Back in the day any guy would see this and say ""well, don't you dare hit on me now"". Nowadays, because everyone wants to be ""inclusive"", they either clap for it, or simply accept it, no questions asked.   Or they hit on me, which is also weird XD.",0
2020 anyone? 👀,0
"Idk i love u no matter what , you a be a bean and I would still love u",0
Me too! You inspire me to be myself and i love you SOOO MUCH!!! 💕💕💕,0
Haha gayy,1
When you coming out as a racist?,0
"I came out to my friends, parents and brother as bi when I was 12, so in 2017 Ever since then, I've felt more me More ok",0

"It is currently May 27, 2020. I am in the United States of America and this video is helping me come out in the middle of a pandemic. 🏳️‍🌈✌🏻 Sending my love to the lgbtq community!",0
"I know I’m 5 years late, but I’m just wanna say that I’m so proud of Shane and how far he’s come and also that I’ve been really struggling with my sexuality a lot recently and that this really helped and I’m so thankful he made this video (seeing this actually made me cry)💜💛",0
Quarantine has brought me back to this,0
"I never saw this video when it first came out because I don't know why to be honest. I just saw the thumbnail and was ""Oh okay, guess he's bi makes sense I guess"" but it's sad to see it now and how sad he was all these years because he couldn't accept or didn't know who he was. It's crazy now that he's doing great and I hope for the best for Shane because he's been a great part of my childhood. And yes it's pretty fucked up that I watched his older videos when I was a kid but who else didn't?",0
He was so sad that he would not find love but now he is engaged with ryland!,0
ok,0
AH,0
Shame we all support you and you helped me to find out that I am also bisexual!,0
"I'm watching this at age 12.... I just realized that I am a bisexual and I cant tell anybody, but none if my friends will be reading this so it should be ok. Umm... if anybody else has come out, any tips maybe? I'm literally terrified",0
2020 anybody,0
we love you and you helped me come out as bi too...never EVER change who you are you are a queen&lt;3,0
I will love Shane for the rest of my life and beyond my death,0
My son is bisexual. His Dad and I adore him.  He is an amazing person. The way he tells it is he falls in love with people. Xx,0
My lesbian demigirl ass     I LOVE COMING OUT VIDEOS,0
I am bisexual and I came out to my friends about a year and a half ago. It was one of the best moments of my life. They were all so excepting and supportive. It felt like a weight being lifted off my shoulders. I am really scared to come out to my family because I don’t know how there going to react. Does anyone have any advice on telling them? that would really help.❤️,0
The bio says everything❤️,0
"I've recently found out that I'm bisexual, even though I was when I was 11 and 12, I still struggle with my sexuality, I've always been so confused, but I found out who I really am, I know how you feel.",0
don't be sad i am too,0
"Shane you helped me realize I'm bisexual too... Thank you! I truly love you and your videos, they keep me having a will to not stop and not give up. Thank you. You really are awesome 💜💜",0
I’m so confused because I legit thought this happened like before 2010 from what I remember??,0
"As a bisexual person - I'm very touched by this video! I've had so many issues with driving myself crazy with labels and trying to figure out if I'm kidding myself or what. This video really just goes to show that it's a universal experience and that it's ok to just put those labels aside and just say ""I love people"". Full stop! Thank you Shane!",0
UR A RACIST BLACK FACE,0
"no one:  me: watching this mid-may of 2020...   also can we talk about how he said ""idk who im going to end up with"", AND HE'S LITERALLY ENGAGED NOW",0
this still helps in 2020 btw. thank you,0
Look at where you are today Shane &lt;3 Ryland was meant for you &lt;3 !!!!!!!!!!,0
Who’s bingeing Shane during the covid 19 pandemic 😅,0
When I was a kid I was straight until I turned 20 and found girls more attractive and thought guys were ugly even myself,0
We all knew this,0

I know that this is every youtube commet ever now but honestly I'm all for watching videos I've already watched a million times and honestly I think that the covid 19 kinda made us appreciate these videos even more now and I love that.,0
Let's  be honest here no one was surprised.,0
Lily Singh has been overruled.  Thank fucc ,0
"I know I’m so late to this and you probably won’t see this but I wanna say i know how you feel cuz I’ve been there and if you don’t like labels,well to bad cuz  I’m labeling you as human  just like Ryland and Garett. Love ya and keep up all of your great work and content😊",0
crazy to think this video only came out 5 years ago!!&lt;3,0
James Charles entered the chat,0
Dude it's ok to be gay,0
"I believe that all people r 'bisexual', the reason people take sides is because Exclusively 'Gay' people can not hide from the discrimination, while people who identify as 'heterosexual' r too afraid of not fitting in (being acceptable to the norm) to challenge their fear of intimacy with others.  In my world what is attractive to me about another person is how comfortable they r where in the same situation I am not, hence being with people who r more comfortable in them selves then I am in the same situation,  teaches me to become comfortable like them.",0
It’s ok Shane  u can be wat u wanna be  leap up the good work,0
Me: 🥺🥺🥺 Everyone: 🥺🥺🥺 Roland: 😏😏😏,0
"You know.. i think im bisexual too. but im Christian, and i don't wanna except it...",1

Aww Shane. You have come so far on a road of self+discobery. Go Shane! You are so brave.,0

i’m bi too i’ve only told my friends,0
Jojo Siwa my gay icon,0
What's a queer crush? Isn't that just a crush?,0
We can marry freely why the fuck do we demand more?,1
I think we should stop using the rainbow as money scam and just be us and support ourselves without forcing others to get on page. We are based on equality and all the rainbow has done is demand this and that based on money and not rights. I’m so ashamed of what people in charge have bullshited represented our rainbow to be. Enough is a fucking enough.,1
I'm not a queer person but I love the queer community. It's lovely to see all the different types of people.,0
Good God .... 😨,0
I may be wrong... But is that Joan Jett at 4:17 ?,0

Stupid woke losers,0
Aww i love how they invite Shane and Alice from The L Word i'd be gay for Kate and Leisha if i have not already been,0
If your mommy was gay... And your daddy was gay... Would you exist BIATCH???,1
there is one reason i clicked on this video,0
"I love this!  As a ""young lesbian"" (30 years ago) I had the same ""complaints"" about the older gays.  Don't worry, we're all together and there is a bond we all share.  Thank goodness!",0
gained a lot of fashion inspiration,0
What a wicked generation.,0
"I just don't understand one thing,people say ""gender is social construct.sex is biological"" fine Transgender says ""Men trapped in women's body vice versa changes to other sex and tells gender is social construct"" If it Is social construct and not related to sex then why are they transitioning. Then who is wrong trans people or other LGBTQ people say gender is social construct.Can someone please explain.",1

"Ageism :   stereotyping people based on their age or generation, both young and old.    Example: assuming we have little in common",0

Identity is all an illusion,0
"So, what are Kat Moening's thoughts on the movement to make lesbian defined as ""a woman who's attracted to women regardless of biological sex?"" Just a hunch, but I can't help but feel that most of the persons featured here believe that you aren't a real lesbian unless you're a woman who eats tacos and rides the GD train.",1
We NEED LESBIAN BARS AND CLUBS!!!-ASAP!,0
i can’t focus on this video or breathe tbh i only pressed on it from katherine moenning,0

"as a gay queer, this video helps me so much in unleashing my true self and expressing myself in my own unique way. this is also very informative. thank you so much.",0
Awesome i love this video!😊☺😊,0
This is an awesome and absolutely beautiful kind of video. Giving my respect to them and to other people who are part of these communities. I also agree that “Chosen family are the people that know you and love you for exactly who you are.”,0
WE ARE ENOUGH!,0

"I’m an internal butch but external total femme and my wife is a soft butch but internal EXTREME femme. Like, if we had a flat, I would be changing the tire, with my hair that’s down to my butt, healed boots, a dress and red lipstick. Which I have before. While she sat in the car with her butch haircut, short nails, flannel shirt and LL bean boots on 🤣 I’m fire, she’s ice. She’s a pushover with the kids, I’m the lay down the law. And when it comes to top and bottom, we’re switch hitters all the way. We’re just weirdos, walking contradictions, books with deceiving covers, which is why we work so well together 😂 We’ve been together 11 years, she’s 11 years older than me because I’ve always been older than my years (I’ve literally lived on my own since 16 as an emancipated minor, graduated high school at 16, got my first college degree at 18, and owned my first home at 19, and at 42, recently officially retired from a very successful career with a great pension) and without a doubt the love of my life. The age difference freaked her out when we first met. But the more she got to know me, the more she discovered she’s younger than me in a lot of ways actually. I feel ancient. Like I’ve lived several lifetimes. But I’ve always had much more in common with people older than me compared with those in my own age group who, at no fault of their own, seemed extremely immature and naive just because I was so advanced for my age. I’ve only ever been with someone younger one time. A longggg time ago too. And that was only by 3 years 😂 So we are strange us human beings. There is no wrong or right when it comes to being in LGBTQ spectrum. I’ve had relationships before where I was harshly judged because I didn’t fit the “femme” stereotype. And it used to hurt me a lot. And then I figured out it’s not a me problem. We just weren’t the right people for each other. And maybe they were afraid of who I was, because they weren’t comfortable enough in who they were and feeling insecure. But there was nothing wrong with me. So, If it feels natural and right to you, just be you. Because you are the only one who can. And please believe, there is someone out there who will LOVE the you you are, and fit perfectly with you precisely because you are you. So let your freak flag fly, embrace your weirdness, and never be afraid of rocking that out. And if the person you’re with doesn’t appreciate that, they aren’t the right person for you. Wishing you all ♥️, ☮️, and happiness.",0

People being unlucky with genes.,0

"There is once from a million other times again that there is no ace and/or aro representation in the LGBTQ community. For the question of who was your crush, I had none. For the question of who is your queer icon, I do have a few (ex. Billie Joe Armstrong from Green Day) but not any who represent my identity. There haven’t really been any ace/aro icons, so I must become that for myself and others. EDIT: There actually is an aro-ace activist that I connect myself to, she’s not a mainstream icon, but her name is Yasmin Benoit. She is a dark alternative and lingerie model, in addition to aro-ace activist and Youtuber.",0
Queer icon: Rina Sawayama. They even referenced chosen family in this video LOL,0
Leisha 😩,0
0:32 She looks like my old teacher. I wonder if it is. She was coolish.,0
"The 'as a Transmasculine non-binary person there isn't many people i can look up to' hit hard as ,as of now i also identify as transmasc non-binary and i don't know how im supposed to progress and happy pride month my fellow queers",0
"All men have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God, the wages for our sin is death. The Good news is that God so loved the world, that he sent his ONLY begotten son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for our sins. Whoever believes in their heart that Jesus died on the cross, rose again on the 3rd day and confesses with their mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, will be saved. God created us to have a relationship with him, only through Jesus can we be reunited with him.",0
So many females omg,0
So many beautiful people &lt;3,0
What is this,0
"""non binary trans masculine individual"". What does it mean ?",0
"PLEASE SEEK HELP IN JESUS CHRIST , IT IS CLEAR YOU ALL HAVE EXPERIENCED SOME KIND OF PAIN AND ABUSES AND IT IS YOUR WAY OF DEALING WITH YOUR PAINS BY GOING AGAINST THE NORM AND SOCIETY VALUES BUT IT IS THE WRONG WAY! SO JESUS IS KNOCKING YOUR DOOR AND PLEASE OPEN THE DOOR AND TALK TO HIM ABOUT YOUR ABUSES N PAINS, HE UNDERSTANDS, COME TO HIM AND REST MY BELOVED 😘😘✝️✝️✝️",1
So what I’ve taken is that there’s a disconnect within the lgbtq+ community. Frankly I don’t think the younger generation accepts the older ones and the older ones are so used to their way of life that the younger ones are “too much” or something for them.,0
"Honestly, I don't know if I have a queer icon",0

Why? Because we have to, because we  are  ""born this way."" And when you, as well - our parents and friends - choose love over hate and ignorance, and so choose to love  us  ... well, for many of us, that is love's greatest miracle.  And we thank you for it with all our hearts.)",0
leisha and kate :D,0
I love the term queer :) to me it just means I’m not straight. I guess I’m technically pansexual but I also feel very fluid in my gender as well as my sexuality and I may be somewhere on the ace spectrum. To me I haven’t totally been able to decide on these labels but I don’t feel a need for labels or categorizing myself. I like queer because I can convey that I’m not straight but I don’t have to give details about my sex life or gender or whatever. I just like who I like. I just am.,0

"Did anyone else really didn't like it when the older lady talks about community and karaoke, and then it cuts to a young girl who's like ""I don't have a lot in common with you""...

Oooh i kinda hoped there wil be a bi or an asexual person but...,0

What is the scientific underpinning for this very concept? It seems that these people are just deeply confused and need to figure themselve out (perhaps with a psychologist).,1

I’m an attack Helicopter,1
“Who was your first queer crush?” “Weird Al Yankovic” Wh-,0

So queer just means gay right?,0
"""I mostly live in fantasy world"" ME!",0
Whew Shane and Alice 👌,0

"Watching this made me realize I have so many lesbian/bi role models, I'm so lucky.",0
The lady at 2:26 looks SO MUCH like Jessica Lange that it’s surreal!,0

What about the Bi Community. I'm bi and we get a lot of hate that we don't know what we want. We just love whatever gender for their personality not their appearance.,0

"Oh man, 5:46 hot 💯",0
"This is an awesome video. I'm just sad I never heard the word ""bisexual."" I will always have love for Kate because Shane was everything when I was 16. I also came out when I was 16. I'm 32 now...",0
I find it interesting it was mostly white women who wanted to appreciate elders whereas the non white people spoke about not relating to the old white lesbians or finding their own subset within the LGBT community,0
Who is the girl at 1:04 please ? I'm in love.,0
that was some real shit at 4:13,0
'What do you identify as?'' ''fat'' wtf. What a sad existens if thats your identity,0
"Shane looks so different now, she’s still hot but I think she looked so much hotter with the badass rocker style she had in the original LWord.",0
The girl with the blond curly mohawk is hot as hell! 😍,0
"I feel as though a lot of time bisexuality isn't really accepted in the LGBTQ+ community. I am a lesbian woman but I have seen and heard all the time, that gay women do not want to date bisexual women because they don't think that bisexual women are for real or would take them seriously. I think that is so wrong. I dated a bisexual woman and although I'm not together with her anymore I would probably say she was the most loyal and loving partner I've had. I dated a gay woman and she cheated on me so.  I see many Tinder profiles that say, ""if you are bisexual, don't swipe right."" We are supposed to be the most open and inclusive to all people, yet we are doing the very same thing that we have tried to escape from our whole lives. We of all people should understand. The bi-phobia needs to stop.",0
when u notice that all of them are females... then u realize some people don't do that anymore,0
My queer icon is Cheryl Blossom &lt;3,0
I wish their age was put next to them when they talked to understand their perspective more,0
Please may my future wife look and think like this woman at 3:23,0

I'm being bullied by my ex for being gay. I'm happy I am.,0
"""People have always had sexual freedom if they had power and resources."" Preach!",0
Lmao were all just gonna be days by that point,0
"I'm crying. I love watching videos like these because it's all so true and the LGBTQ+ community can sometimes be hypocritical towards its own members. We should all just be able to be ourselves, openly, and honestly, whether others understand it or not. Sometimes people can forget that and get judgemental. I really want everyone in our community to just accept each other like we want to be accepted. No racism, no sexism, no gatekeeping, no ""you're doing it wrong"". Just let people live.",0
Is that Christine Sydelko?,0
Is that the girl from Ray Donoven ?,0
Why they are all afab????,0
it’s damn beautiful to see how diverse our community is,0
How can u be non binary and trans at the same time? Doesn't non binary mean that you don't identify as any gender?,1
didn’t even know who shane was but wow she is so attractive fuck,0
the girl with the brown hair and the black jacket is iconic lmao,0
I came out to my sisters when I was drunk. I cried my eyes out and all they said to me was “we knew already”,0
Why not older. Don’t feature children under 18 in a video.,0
Very cool. I learned some stuff,0
This low key makes me uncomfortable. But good for them for speaking out,0
"Please, translate it or let us do &lt;3 People who talk other languages need this to! I wanna sent it to my family and they onlye speak portuguese",0
"I see Kate, I click",0
"Great work putting Kate Moenning as the thumbnail. Caught alotta gays, me included. I was scrolling and the vid pops up on recommended and i was like ""wait go back..was that shane..?  clicks video  "" XD",0

Seems to be a distinct lack of gay men?,0
I wasn't going watch immediately until I did a double take and was like    Hold on is that Shane? ,0
"Our unity shouldn't be about RACE, AGE, CULTURE, RELIGION, OR WHAT ONE CALLS THEMSELVES, we are all part of the same group/family, QUEER! And as women, especially, we NEED to unite, because just like straight women, we queer women are pushed aside often, but by not only straight men, but gay men too!  I mean this the new L Word series, will I believe be the first series to have a cast member who is a Tran man, we have seen plenty of Trans females, but few Trans males in film or TV!  Though I am not blaming Trans women for that, it's a media thing, men always get more attention, even when they are no longer a man!  But really, all  QUEER people need to unite, whether male, female or neither, no matter what you identify as, we should all be on each others side, not just one or the other!  But, unfortunately, men, well gay and straight men, have little to no respect or concern for us women, whether we're gay, trans, bi or straight or anything else, if your female or identify as female, your suddenly less the human, because your not male!  Remember women up until the 1900's were seen all over the world, including here in the US, as the same as live stock, just the way African slaves were seen here in the US, ALL women were seen as NOT really the same level of human as men were! Oh they didn't seem to know what to call us exactly, but, scientists had us down in books and on documents back in those days, as being like things for men to buy or acquire, men were supposed to get a job, and then a wife, to have offspring with, but it was like we were LITERALLY BABY MAKING MACHINES for the men to buy in someway or another or sell, if they were the women's father, if there was no father, then brother, if no males, then maybe mother, but maybe they then just took them!  It wasn't always actual money of course, sometimes we were just talking image, and sometimes the men weren't the rich ones, so they were the ones getting rich by marrying the woman!  And as we all know, in some countries today, things aren't any different then they were a 100 years ago elsewhere!    And most don't realize that when it comes to gay people, gay women/Lesbians, were not the one's being arrested in places like in Europe or even the US, it was mostly men, because anal sex/sodomi was a crime, NOT so much two men kissing or anything else they might do! Which means if gay men weren't known to have sex that way, seeing them kissing, wouldn't have gotten them in any trouble in most places!    Of course it's mostly a crime because of religion, Judaism, Christianity and Islam all have it as a sin, but nothing about kissing another man if your a man or another woman if your a woman, at least not until later when the words homesexual was added in some books of those religions!",1
SHANE AND ALICE YEAAH BABY THE L WORD IS BACK ❤❤❤❤ WOOOOOHOOOOO THANK YOU SHOWTIME,0
"3:14 maybe if you stoped focusing on people’s age and skin color and focused on substance, you would discover you might have more in common than you think.",0
Leisha Hailey 🥰 she is a TRUE gay ICON. She’s been doing lgbt movies since she was a teenager,0
Diversity of people is such a treasure and everyone that make it more diverse is a treasure to the society 💕💕💕💕💕💕,0
"Kate &amp; Leisha, pls kiss me.",0
Educate older peers. There have no other frame of reference than the one pioneered for the community to be where it is today. Respect that enough to take the time to share and explain the evolution from their revolution.,0
"Bro when kate licked her lips i was like, no please don't do that...now i can't stop thinking of how ilI will always be attracted to her😍🏳️‍🌈",0

Love your neighbor as yourself,0
"""What's something you'd want to communicate to the previous generation of queer people?""  My answer would be: ""I'm sorry that somehow straight people, brands, including production company like ""Cut"" call you the very slur you were insulted with and who's still used as a slur against us by homophobes."" I'm tired of it, so SO tired of it.",0
i dont know why but im crying omg,0
Why doesn’t this channel ever put the @s of the people in the video   Does anyone know who’s that at 1:36 👀,0
"Wow 6:14 really brought out the tears, I’m really crying",0
"when she said 'fat, queer' I felt that",0
"It's ironic how big of a deal people seem to make about all of this, queer or non queer people. Why can't we just be people. There's nothing special about being queer and nothing special about being straight either. I'm gay and it's never been a big deal to me because it's just one small aspect of me. It doesn't define me, my political leanings, hobbies or my beliefs, it's just another biological part of me, like my eye color or the fact that i'm left handed. None of this matters. What should matter is the content of your character, if you're a toxic person or not. How you treat others and the world around you is so much more important than what hole you like to stick it in, or what pronoun you feel suits you the best.  In 50 years none of this matters. That's whats up.",0
"damn, the world is fucked up. gotta learn that in school i understood shit",0
"Someone please help me, I am confused I thought Kate monneig identified as a straight woman???? Is she like being “Shane” here or is the actress in real life gay ???? HELP",0

Yikes,0
"""Needing to take space sometimes is valid and it doesn't mean we're invalidating their experiences"" 👏👏👏👏👏👏",0
"I would tell my younger self that there is a reason you are attracted to people and that you can see that attraction within yourself. Once I started expressing my exterior self more queerly, my inner self felt more confident. I am so proud to be part of such a diverse community and hope that in 50 years there will be every representation available (plus new and changing ones) in media, music, porn, art and commerce.",0
How do i identify? ...i'm a dude,0
“how do you identify”  “fat”  no,0
Despite the the fact that this video is really inspiring ! I also loooooooooove this cuz for once the people that are in charge to talk for the queer community  are not white gay cis gender men ! And that is sooooooo good !,0
Thank you for this 💕,0
"Y'all this is literally queerbaiting wtf. 16-65 in the video title - like 10 people speak throughout the video, with no gay males, or aces or aros or pan or demi or bi people (even if they were any of these sexualities it's hardly stated outloud). Cut, if you're putting 'queer' in the title, actually give us the rep to back that up smh. If I wanted to read subtext, I wouldn't be here.",0
We are so beautiful ❤ I'm so happy to be apart of this community.,0

Me when I saw Shane in the thumbnail     🤭🤭🤭😮😮😮,0
I have OCD and the fact that this was not in order made my chest tight but I still really enjoyed watching it and seeing the different perspectives,0
"I hope in 50 years people won't feel so hesitant to be themselves. I am still coming to terms with myself and my sexual identity because at one point it was drilled into me that some people fake being gay. So in high school when I had a boyfriend for a few years (still with him) but was also watching lesbian porn I was really confused. I didn't want to be in a relationship with a girl or I couldn't see myself being in a relationship with a girl yet I was watching lesbian porn. I brushed it aside and just kept telling myself I couldn't be a lesbian and I couldn't be bi since I didn't want to date girls. Once I found out that my definition of bi was wrong (many years later) I started to wonder if maybe I was bi but was still scared to think about it because I didn't want to be ""faking it"" without knowing it. Was being sexually attracted to girls enough? What if I hadn't found a girl I would like to hook up with in real life is it maybe just a fantasy of mine and not what I actually want? Maybe I do have those thoughts but I've drilled it into myself that I can't. It's something I still am struggling with today and I'm scared to tell people since I can't fully accept it myself.",0
baby aint nobody saying ellen is their queer icon LMFAOOOO,0

"I recently rewatched the entirety of the original l word and I was honestly surprised by a lot of the blatantly transphobic, racist and biphobic things that were written. the show didn’t age well at all but I understand that it’s just a reflection of society and the culture at the time. max’s storyline in particular fucked up my perception of trans men and made me hesitant to admit that I was trans for a long time which sounds ridiculous but he was and unfortunately still is one of the only representations of trans men on tv so I’m honestly just glad that they seem to be being more inclusive and conscious this time around. when I first started watching the show I was maybe 10 or 11 years old and I identified as a lesbian, now I’m 22 and I identify as a bi/queer trans man. crazy how things change over time but it just goes to show you how important representation is",0

"We had a discussion about nonbinary gender identity at my workplace yesterday.  There were two RN's who are millennials (and one had said a handful of things against LGBTQ rights in the past year that I've worked with her).  We've had LGBTQ patients (including trans and nonbinary), but they hadn't given much thought into nonbinary gender identity being a legit until Billy Dee Williams just came out.  Suddenly, they didn't know how to respond or how to approach learning about this, and I (as a likely trans illustrator with a day job at a hospital) started diagraming ways of explaining this subject to two educated young people who grew up with STEM programs.  They looked at me, asking what ""nonbinary"" means.  To these computer savvy peers, I gave the example of binary code (explaining that for a long time many societies only considered there to be two gender identities).  Then I integrated 2's, 3's, 4's, and 5's into an example of what was a line of binary code (0's and 1's).  Comprehension was hit or miss, so I then diagrammed a gender spectrum, stating that cisgender, trans, or nonbinary, each person's gender identity can fit somewhere along the spectrum between male and female and sometimes legitimately fluctuate in such cases as gender fluidity.  They got a better understanding of the subject.  It was sort of like when I explained gender dysphoria to an some IV nurses saying that they are like Pop Tarts or instant oatmeal packets, where just through a twist of fate, who they are is misrepresented by the box that the manufacturer had accidentally shipped them out in.  It wasn't until I was in my early 30's that I started becoming more self-conscious of whether I was miscommunication my gender identity (my having Asperger's may have affected realization on how important physical expression of self can be in communicating with everyone other than myself).  I started exploring gender expression (for the first time in decades) through Second Life and Pokemon Go avatars.  The morning after the Pulse shooting (Pride weekend in many cities including, my own), I decided that I should be openly proud of whatever I am as I began figuring out what gender (and relatively, what sexuality labels) I identify with I've gone from walking with my church in the Pride parade to volunteering at a call center to protect a state law prohibiting discrimination against trans and nonbinary people (in so much partisan irony, the law was signed by a republican governor, and it was a famously blue state that was trying to referendum against the law being upheld).  I've started growing my hair out, and have been increasingly working in more feminine aesthetics into my personal style.  While people may think that clothing should not be explicitly ""masculine"" or ""feminine"", it's those possibilities in gender-related clothing which can be more affirming for people who aren't cisgender, while striping away the gender association could make people more dysphoric.",0

What does being queer mean to you?,0
I'm not sure I grasped the idea of queer  What is the difference between bisexual and queer?,0
Yooo,0
"From my understanding, being queer means being not straight, but not having/wanting a label for who you like.   Example: maybe you’re non binary attracted to women sexually and men emotionally   Or maybe ur cis and like both men and women in a non sexual way, but still have sexual urges? (On the ace spectrum but no specific label or multiple labels)  At least I think that’s what it is?",0
I'm not gay or anything I'm just I guess mainstream heterosexual but I I honestly honestly believe that people should be identified if they want to be identified for who and what they are and what they stand for truly we have one life on this planet we need to be good to each other that's what my dad used to say and my dad broke away from Mormonism big time when he married my mom cuz my mom was a mother Earth follower. I had a really great parents growing up I I only wish that for other people I'm totally blown away by how cruel and how mean and how broken the belief system can be and forced upon a child or their teenager or their young adult is is baffling to me one life it's all we have unless you know one of those people that believe in reincarnation and hey more power to you I like I like the idea trust. But really we just need to be good to each other That's all I got to say thank you so much for the video,0

So the SJWs got offeneded by people saying they where super straight and saying it wasnt a sexuality... because blah blah homophoia blah blah transphoia blah blah.  Yet these same peeople have never ever critisted a single queer person.  And apprently queer is not wnating a label for sexuality or/and gender.,1
So if someone doesnt identify with any label including queer are they hyper queer.  4 Billion years of evolution and we somehow ended up at this.,1

If you want to be something different then what you're born as then fine. But don't expect and force people to view you in the same light. You'll be seen as you are not as you want to be.,1
1:56 you dont have to know who or what you are and that's ok??? ho no!!!! what a world we live,1
I think that there shouldn't be a label for kind of sexuality.... Because why should anybody care whom you are in love with? I think the idea of this came from reproduction... Because a female and a male can reproduce and that's what people identified as nature so the idea of a male and a male or a female and a female relationship seemed to them as something against the nature.... If you know what I mean. But these two things are totally different because love is more than just reproducing that's why I think that there shouldn't be a label like being gay or straight or whatever... That should not be significant.  You love who you love.,0
So basically there confused and dont want a label so choose to be under an umbrella,0
this doesn’t explain it at all,0
Is it not bisexual,0
isn’t it funny when girls thinks their boys but don’t have masculine chromosomes,1

"They could’ve just said it’s an umbrella term for anyone who identified as something outside of heterosexual or heteronormative. Instead they just had people talk about themselves, which is great, but it didn’t really explain the answer to the question. This is why people get confused.",0

"wait,  i am very confused what is my sexuality but i can tell im pretty gay and not straight but at somepoint there will be possibilities in the future that i might be with a man so it's really confusing but rn i hate boys/men. But for some reason i don't want to label myself or identify myself to something. But i know to myself im gay. so im just a girl who's gay and confused",0
"(A venting mess of an essay)  I hate when people refer to me by my gender, as girl, chick, lady, woman, female, whatever, but any male equivalents don't suit me and I certainly don't thing going by ""they"" or the x pronouns are fitting. So I settle with my assigned at birth gender, and I don't know why, but it makes me kind of uncomfortable. Maybe it's due to bad experiences with the expectation to fit those labels, maybe it's because some people refer to me this way to be somewhat demeaning, or maybe I have a lot of exploring to do. On top of all that mess of nonsense, I am attracted to all genders.  Ultimately I want to identify as queer, until I find an identity that I see myself in, if ever. It's like the Hermes cabin in Camp Halfblood! But because of the state of mind that some people have against the word (as it used to be a slur), or against the idea of identifying as queer (it's too different and too outlandish) I ultimately settle as a cisgendered bisexual, even if I don't think it fits me.  I feel like I'm lying to myself. It's not about the label, it's about trying to find myself, and what will make me comfortable. Right now, someone harmlessly calling me ""girlie"", ""chica"" or ""female"" makes me tense up and I WISH I knew why.  Also, this video that is supposed to raise awareness and promote open-mindedness towards the concept of queer is an unfortunate failure. It was too surface level and didn't so much go into the definition of queer, which I think is why so many people were estranged more than anything. A more suitable title would be ""Why I identify as queer"" or ""How I found the Queer identity."" As is, the title leads people to click expecting to get a definition. It would fit as a great intro to something that might go more in depth or be more grounded.",0

"A lot of negative replies here so I want to add something! I’m queer and I identify as this because it’s an umbrella term meaning “not straight or not cisgender”. I’ve always felt fluid with my sexual orientation and gender identity so being queer allows me to like who I like and feel what I feel without worrying about whether or not I’m fitting into a specific box. So to anyone uncomfortable or upset about the usage of the term queer, it literally has nothing to do with you. Mind your own. 💖💗💕🌺🍒  Edit: instead of being pressed about what label somebody uses to explain their sexuality / gender how about focusing on actual issues that affect this community??? Do y’all get upset abt queer eye?? lol",0
Humans are by far the frickin weirdest creatures when it comes to sexual preferences. Literally. Aren’t there something like 72 genders according to... uh... people?? The closest animal that we get to this... behavior is the flamingo. That’s. It. They RARELY (but sometimes) have same gender relationships and one time I even heard from a zoo that there was a trio relationship. If you want to bring up the topic of animals that literally change gender; those animals ACTUALLY change gender (into a BOI OR GURL that’s it). Humans... we physically CANNOT change gender. It’s not possible. Also all the people in this video kinda look the same ngl,1

What’s wrong with being straight? So the lgbtq is everything besides straight. Why not include being straight so at the end of the day people just like whatever they like and as long as they don’t force others to do or want anything the. We can all live peacefully. If it had that meaning I think that would be better. Idk if it’s just me but the lgbtq being everything besides straight seems like the wrong direction. Cause people also have fetishes but they don’t decide to define themselves based on their fetishes. Not saying that the lgbtq is basically just fetishes but people focus way to damn hard on their sexuality. You like what you like and it’s that simple.,1

"Thank you. I'm older, and when I was in middle and high school, calling someone ""queer"" was a horrible insult. I've always had a hard time saying it. Kind of like the ""n"" word. Thanks for helping me understand it's meaning and that it's not necessarily a bad word.",0
So basically it means people who don't know what they like or what gender or sex they are..(just an opinion),1
"FYI. There’s something called personal fault. Its where you believe that you are something but because of your lack of self consciousness, you end up not being able to see what you truly are and that’s where friends and family come in. They tell you what you’re doing and what’s happening when you can’t see clearly at the time. Not to say that friends and family know everything because of course they aren’t you so they can never know feel the degree of emotion that you feel but they can understand it with time and all of you can work together on becoming better and making each other better by identifying each other’s flaws and fixing them but not bullying each other with those flaws",0
At the end of the day. When you label stuff you are just conforming to society. If you care that much about labels then you probably care that much about the opinions of people or you did when you did care. My point is that at the end of the day it comes down to what you think about yourself and how much you let what people tell you affect you.,0

Genderqueer is someone who identify themselves not a man or woman which the normative always said that man should be male or woman should be female. Genderqueer not a sexual orientation. Its mindset of gender  genderfluid is someone who identify themselves not a masculine or feminim which the normative always said that male should be masculine and female shouldbe feminim. Genderfluid not a sexual orientation. Its a gender expression.  The Non-Binary is mindset gender who always change from the spectrum of man -- woman or between them.  There are epicene/efeminency which actually put you as a demigender.,0
You don't explain anything. You hyst share your personal issues and involve  EVERYBODY in them.  But they're only yours :),0
"They like who they like, love who they love, and are whatever or whoever they are. They don't want the stress of having a label claiming they're this, or that they're that, they are just human. (Also just a quick question: If you go by non binary pronouns or opposite gender pronouns, can you just say that's queer as well or do you have to say, ""I'm non binary and queer."" ?)",0
I came here to see if I was queer and I don’t even know if I’m queer either 😂,0
I CRIED WTF THIS IS SO RELATABLE,0
"since people still seem to be confused: identifying as queer means loving whoever you want, despite you or the other person’s gender identity; it’s basically an umbrella term which many other sexualities/identities can fall under",0
"So basically people who want attention but are not a minority can use this as a label, ok",0
Or I'm everything,0
Omg i not bi I'm queer or both😅,0
"My thoughts: I think there is a difference between sexuality and emotional attraction and physical attraction and spiritual attraction. So, to me, if Queer means solely sexual attraction, I'm heterosexual.",0
"I just came here to find out what is means cause I get called it all the time and now I am depressed cause I know what it means now and I don’t want to associate with that, no offense to any but a man can have his own opinion and you can’t get mad at that",0

It’s the new thing to do it’s cool it’s a trend it will did out of use like Facebook did,0
"that’s the point they fail there own ideology they want gender fluidity to rid the idea of boxing /categorising  so the give not giving a label by giving it a label and labelling it lol , all things need to be categorised it’s how we identify the works around us",1
I think according to this video  LGBT= Q,0
I'm so confused right now. Do we even need this term ? there is already a term for everything why do we gotta do this more complicated ? XD,0
"Is it me or do these types of individuals all look the same? They always have weird haircuts which are often dyed to these luminous/florescent colors, loads of piercings in weird places, tattoos and colorful clothing.",0
Lol still doesn’t make any sense😂,0
"A false statement ,The more That we realise that  gender and sexuality are all made up and are just lie ok then why do you want to be so conservative and add to the conventional concept of categorising and boxing people into yet another form, you can love who ever you want but genders tend to help you know who it is your attracted to",0
"Basically: I'm straight cisgender but I still wanna be in the LGBTQ community so I dress androgynously and tell people they HAVE NO RIGHT TO DEFINE ME!""  Also, vocal fry the last half of every sentence",1

"guess what....there is no such thing as trans, there is no way scientifically that you can change ur chromosomes from male chromosomes to female or vise-versa",1

I respect u all... I love LGBTQ community,0
Why should we listen to this dummies,0
What are you people,0
In easy words = they can be bi or gay or pansexual but the thing is they don’t label themselves.,0
Stupidity,0

You'll never see Trump disgrace the nation by lighting up the Whitehouse in rainbow colors.  What a joke that Muslim Marxist was.,1
"Can somebody help me, I usually date boys but actually my first dating partner was a girl(my mom's boss daughter), I had a crush on a trans guy, I like the female curves on guys and love the mansculity of a woman, usually a girl who is like a guy... I like middle hair for both... I would date anyone who fits into that category... What the heck am I? I only date one person at a time... I identify myself as a girl, I also have a vaj... That's for who I am, I sometimes dress boss and others cute and girly.... Mostly 80s style but I want to know what am I?",0
So is queer bi? Pan? I’m still so confused,0
"queer to me means non-normative, non-conformative ... we are not comfortable with the identity of the lgbt part but we are definitely not heterosexual..some can still be said confused but mostly we are intelligent..we discover ourselves and research more..",0
i was still looking for the meaning but naah,0
"They are bunch of confused people who don't know what there sexuality is, what's going on to this world",0
Bruh,0
"So what I gather from this video, is that ""queer"" means ""confused as fuck.""",1
Am i the only person who didnt get the answer?,0
Gender is not a lie but sexuality might be.,0
"they didn't explain what a queer is and I see alot of people here are confused. Let me explain: You got yourself a job and in the job interview you meet the boss of the company, and the first thing you notice is that you can't even see if it's a guy or a girl, so you go with the ""he"" pronoun as default, since, after all, you didn't see the tits. You try to use every technique you can to tell the gender - the voice, the hair, the waist, the face (does he has mascara?) but you see no mascara, he seems to have a waist like a lady and the voice is well... like justin bieber. After a whole interview of confusion you decide to take the giant step and ask him ""Sorry for asking this, but are you a woman or a man"" He respond, ""I am queer - I have no gender."" You got even more confused - how can somebody not have a gender? what pronoun do you even use for such a person? ""He""? ""She""? ""XE????""   But that's the point of being a queer - a queer person doesn't want you to label ""xim"" as a man or a woman, cause he identifies with having no gender.   That's why I think they are so wonderful - They mindfuck every person they meet, and make people around them question their own reality.",1
I love what Join said. I think we all have something about us we are uncomfortable with when young that we learn to love as we get older. And I love that he not just comfortable with his name but himself.,0
huh might as well call yourself unlabelled,0
"Doesn't fully explain it. But again, I'm not into the whole label BS. It just seems there's a label for everything now and it's becoming ridiculous. My opinion.",0
Thank you for making this video I finally know where I belong!,0
What if your cisgender but use many terms for your sexuality,0
Sorry fam but I still think is offensive word,0
did not answer the question...,0
im an attack helicopter,1
This lgbt thing is such a mess. I really ducked up campaigning for everything at once. Shoulda kept tings seperate. I really think trans is as legitimate as intersex?,1
I think there is no penis  or vagina,0
It is what it is,0
nobody can't define queer,0
I’m really happy that this video was made because I have never really understood the meaning of queer and now I have more of an understanding for it. Thank you seventeen!! ❤️🏳️‍🌈,0
Why did they get so much screen time if they didn’t answer the question? Who edited this?,0
"If no one can tell me what queer is I'm going to consult  Merriam Webster, and roll with it.  You can't be nothing because that's you're going to be treated.",0
It means you're weird,0
I’m not here to hear about your whole life story what the fuck is a queer 😂,1
"This is stupid ,first moment the episode started I'm cringing.",0
Still confused,0
Queers     It's a term of endearment.,0
"Odd, Unusual, Really different. These mixed up genders want to throw it in your face. Yes we get it, your a butt puncher, stop forcing your ""agenda"" on us and knock it off with the circle jerks in your parades, kids are around.",1
Crazy people with mental disorders that is what it is,0
Dis shi gae af lol XD,1
So does it mean bisexual?,0
I’m a trans attack helicopter,1
"They are just confused idiots, they basically think  gender  is a socially constituted thing..you see all of them aren’t wearing clothings or acting like it matches with their gender as THEY are thinking, but here’s the deal..yes society has classified things according to the majority of the gender are associated with, as being feminine or masculine, but if you don’t fall into that majority that matches with your gender, it doesn’t make you genderless you idiot special snowflake, there’s nothing, I repeat NOTHING is called gender identity, that is complete bullshit, I really don’t know how the dumbest people on earth are becoming scientist and now explaining things that aren’t even there, oh god",1
This is Clickbait lol,0
huh?😂,0
"I've seen people saying queer is a slur, is it true?",0
?          .,0
This explains nothing!,0
so you say you identify as queer but you also don’t like labels 🤦‍♀️,0
No one understood so here we go   I believe it’s when u don’t really care at all about the gender or sexuality of a person u just love them because u do  Sorta like pansexuality  But it’s different because u don’t have to know about how u feel i have no idea xD,0
I'm asexual (meaning I'm not attracted to men or women),0
"There are a lot of confused people so this is what the video was getting at, (although no it didn't explicitly say it): Queer is an umbrella term for people who don't feel comfortable conforming to gender norms and or who aren't heterosexual. I think that's what it means.",0
Only two Genders. Male and Female.,1
Why not just call yourself bi,0
Wtf is that means I am more confused now,0
You guys are promoting the moral decline of society. Degenerates.,0
"weren't there like 10 other ""genders"" that are the exact same thing?",1
Does queer mean you dont know what sexuality you are..? I dont understands,1
Lol when she says only i know who i am.... well clearely you dont.,1
"I have so much respect for this, im gay..and this i understand..i choose who i want to be❤",0
Oh i know she/him sexual is girl and transgender and hard to chose no lipstick or lipstick and the gender was Transgender,1
I can understand this concept .. In Tamil film I.. There's a character called Love.. He's a man.. But having a attitude like woman and loves makeup and style... India has to learn more..,0
isnt queer and bisexual the same? Im more confused now,0
"So I googled “Queer” and it says that it means strange, odd, or freakish. So don’t be a Queer or trans.",1
So ''queer'' means the term for those who don't understand their gender...?? I mean they possess both genders in mind and can't completely explain which is the domineering one...!! Am i right God...??,1
ok so thought the comments section would be having a ton of haters but it doesnt it has something better confused haters....,0
"If you understand being confused about your identity you understand queer. Would you, queer identifying, agree?",0
queer is a old homophobic insult stop calling homosexuals queer its insulting,0
"Wait, so your whole shtick is about not fitting in boxes... and you call yourself a queer? Isn't calling yourself queer fitting into one of those boxes?",0
The person with the blue shirt is cute,0
Why do you need any kind of labels? Be yourself and embrace life. oooooh unless you have nothing else to do then throw labels around. It is really starting to get on my nerves...,0

I AM STILL SO FUCKING CONFUSED,0
I understand it as “other” could be many different things but is not one defined label. Correct me if I am wrong.,0
Still don't get it. Is it Bisexual?,0
"So for those who want equality, and be treated "" JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE "" is looking for a label?",0

"In Indonesia we called them  ""TOMBOY"" ",0
So basically ya don't know 🤔,0

Gender is a lie and made up. Um wtf doesn’t that mean?,0

Y’all fuckers just made me more confusion!     And i thought I know what queer was before this video!!!,0
So basically you can be all of them but unlabeled?,0
Gender and sexuality are made up and a lie??? What?!,0
Damn this is so confusing and dumb honestly,0
That is not how the word  queer was used in the book chronicles of Narnia.  Or  how it was taught when I was in school.              QUEER =ODD,0
good luck,0
YOU IDIOTS STILL DID NOT EXPLAIN OR GET TO THE POINT!,0
the comments from idiot bigots make me sad for this generation.,0
Soooooo queer means gender-neutral?,0
"I like girls but I sometimes I like boys but not in a sexual/bi way and identify as queer because it sounds better and doesn't have a full definition. And it feels less toxicated against others. I'm gay but  prefer to label myself as queer. Kinda difficult to explain, mainly because it's a personal reason.",0
Im so jealous of their skin 🥺😢🙄🙏,0
Comment section: 30% Queer means when person is questioning and don't know who to like girl or boys. Or maybe gender fluid! Term is used to call umbrella. 70%.....  But what the fuck is queer? ,1
So queer is a straight person who tries to be Bisexual?,1
You are what you are born as. That’s that!,0
"After a couple years of discovering my sexuality, I finally landed on the word queer/ pan to describe my sexuality. I didn’t like the blocks that the word gay or bi came with so I wanted more of a umbrella term. Sometimes people ask me how gay I am, and unfortunately saying queer doesn’t suffice so I say 90% gay 10% straight just to make it easier for other people... lol.",0
Change gender from time to time  can be woman or man  nothing/no gender...? :0,1
I came after watching a Netflix show...,0
"Were they Crying those Princesses ? I don't Mind them, they all Look to me Yummy, am I Queer ?",0

"1:37 I'ma go ahead and stop you right there...  ""Gender and sexuality are pretty much made up and a lie....""  Human chromosomes, the 23rd pair specifically, are either XX (female) or XY (male). This is Human DNA/Genetics. It isn't made up and/or a lie. That aside... you can call yourself whatever you want. Live your life how it makes you happy at the end of the day. But don't try and tell the world that gender is a lie... that is just a misinformation campaign spreading ignorance. You want to not call yourself a man or a woman, that is your call, because at the end of the day, you're still just a person like the rest of us.",1
"Sorry, gender is related to biological sex, always.",1
"Since most people don't know, and either do I, Here is the answer. ( I googled, read comments, etc.)  So queer is when your not sure if you like Girls, boys, or both. Queer is like a umbrella term. It's like you like girls, you like boys, and you might like both and you figuring that out. Bi is when you know that you like girls and boys. Personally, I feel that they are the same, But I don't know all the information. Thanks for reading! Yeah, I know it was long.   Please like this if it helped your understanding",0
i dont get it,0
They didn't even answer the damn question might as well use Google,0
Joon is such a badass name,0
Joon is such a beautiful name,0
"They all have short hair , that's all i noticed during this video",0
I just saw men but women but then also men but i didnt know what was queer ????,0
"What is QUEER, answer the question 😂",0
So these people are not sure of weather they're human or not wooooow that's  fascinating.,0
Isn't this just non binary,0
"So there's gay for men and men, there's lesbian for women and women, and bisexual for both, so what's left to call a queer? Would someone explain me!",1
I'm a screwdriver 🌈,1
Disgusting,0
So basicaly queer means that you fall in love w/ anybody? Im confused someone help me plz?,0
IM A RAVIOLI.,1
How is gender and sexuality made up tho ?   Because a tiny percentage of people do not live well with how they were born ?,1
If you think you can change your gender you are mentally ill,1
So wait isn't that just bisexual?,0
Head hurts,0
"Yes scientifically there are two genders but if an individual feels like they're one or the other or neither why does it bother a lot of you that a person chooses to identify a certain way ? It has nothing to do with you. Would it kill you to just go with it and be accepting? To live in a world where being right is better than spreading love and encouragement is truly sad and is one day going to be the fall of us all. You can't tell a person who they're supposed to love and you can't tell a person who they're supposed to be. We all should be allowed to live our lives as we please, unapologetically.",0
Queer means you don't have a label,0
"I came here to understand what is queer, now I'm more confused then before.",0
its satanic..,0
soooo... does this mean they're confused what they are and are just trying to figure out what they are?,0
I’m an airplane.,1
"so, the ladies act like boys and the guys like ladies? :v",0
Queer= bisexual,0
"So.........being “queer” is being confused, cause that’s what all this different sexuality stuff is making me. Like damn why do when have to have all the people want to make this group and that group, People are people can’t we just be people like tf",1
Queer for me means ambiguity and being ok with it. I don't really think it's appropriate to use other terms to describe me because they would be too specific and inaccurate.,0
So not one person told me the answer,0
"So... ""queer"" means ""bissexual"" without wanting to call yourself bissexual?",0
For all of you saying you don’t understand: the label was not made for you to understand it.,0
So basically trans 😂🤣,0
😂🤣,0
Im a lemon,1
So they’re pan but just not knowing what gender they are,0
"""I'm bisexual but I've never actually dated a girl before, so I lot of people think I'm straight. Just because I only ever had boyfriends and don't find most girls attractive doesn't mean I'm not gay."" 😵",0

"Sexuality and gender are made up? This is news to me, I’ve been jerking off with an imaginary penis for the last 27 years of my life apparently.",1
Im a sterohitirialitilisexual zebra,1
This is better explained. https://youtu.be/RDO2-sNF2s4,0
I don't want to be labelled but make sure you call me queer?????,1
Im a long hard yellow pencil with a white eraser on the tip,1
So now some human didn't know what gender they are?,1
I think queer is when you know you're on the spectrum but you don't really want to label yourself,0
this is what humanity is becoming ....smh i'm sure the END is near,0
There are only 2 genders,1
What's the difference between gender and sexuality. And...  How would I know what gender you are umm.. do u have a penis or balls no ur a girl.,1
So they reset the dislikes?,0
XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD,0
I still don’t understand it so are they bisexual?,0
So basically they are gay or r straight but don’t wanna call themselves gay or straight..... (maybe because they aren’t comfortable at all with who they are)  Joon is still such a nice name holy fuck,0
They never got to the point and I'm still uneducated,0
Rightly said queer is grey area nobody understand it,0
Joon is soooo sweet like omg~,0
Wtf did I just watch?,0
K but like this didint tell us anything,0
"Male, Female",1
I'm a gay male and I rarely refer to things as 'Queer' discuss...,0
"So ‚queer‘ means that you don‘t know your sexual orientation yet?(bi,pan,...?)",0
"Just an umbrella term because it's too hard to identify I guess or they don't want to or it's easier?... But then ur like OKAY so you can be SO MANY THINGS and just leaves you confused. Queers can be like ""hi, I can be one of many things that I don't know the names of"" which is not identifying at all to me. But it's kinda easy to identify. I found out that the gir- person on 2:11 is pan. You can love anyone, pan. Boom. If someone says they are queer, they're just saying ""I'm something.""",0

"“Gender and sexuality are a lie”. No. I totally support people who don’t exist within a gender binary, or who can’t/choose not to define their sexuality, but some of us find comfort in those labels. I’m so sick of certain members of the LGBT+ community trying to insinuate that the words I use to define myself don’t matter just because they don’t matter to everyone. ~Sincerely, a disgruntled lesbian woman.",0
wait a min...... so after all I am queer?,0
How do I know? Cause biology you know?,0
I just see gays and lesbians.,0
I’ve heard from people that queer can also mean that you like both genders but only wanna date one. Is that true?,0
"This ""umbrella term"" is for people who think/feel/believe that being labelled as gay or bi isn't good enough for them, perpetuating elitism within the LGBT community.",1
Who are the 191 dislikes on this video??,0
So it’s just a person who denies the label bi ?,0
It means that you don't identify as  straight or cisgender pretty much,0
So it’s basically an ambiguous term (more than one meaning)?,0
I somewhat like girls but would only date guys. I like both but not equally? What does that make me? I’m really confused by the terms,0
Sexuality is a lie... Uhhhh no.,0
"Just tell us ,WHAT THE HELL IS ""QUEER""",1
So Queer is when you don’t know what you are... I’m still confused 🤷🏽‍♀️???,1
No one said what queer means,0
I don't believe in labels,0
We just started a collective about this in Belgium. We are looking for people to share stories like this. You can find more info on our website: https://www.theonlygays.com/. Contact us if you're interested! Love from Belgium! &lt;3,0
I’m queer not with my gender but my sexuality,0
"I support LGBT+ but i dont agree with what rowan said. Gender does exist, dont pretend that male and female isn't a thing. If you have no gender identity then thats different but dont just straight up say that gender is made up. You can argue that sexuality is made up but not gender. Female and male is a real thing. Having a Penis or a vagina is a real thing BUT you Dont have to identify with that. Just wanted to state the differences between the fact that female and male does exist and isnt made up and the freedom of opinion to choose to be neither or both or whatever you want! 😀",0
isnt the girl at 0:01 the girl from that 'stop revenge porn' video at the channel AS/IS ?!?!,0
"I'm confused, means queer bisexual? Or means queer being A-Gender? What does it mean now? I saw a video about queer baiting and it sounded like portraying characters as bi or gay without confirming it. But WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?",0
"I love labels, i like coke more than pepsi don't get triggered pls",0
"This is not mental illness. This is plain stupidity at its finest. The most ridiculous thing is how some of ""them"" say I was born in the wrong body. No bitch, God created you like that. Gender this gender that.  I wonder what happened to logical thinking 🤔. I respect everyone equally.  I think this is madness and poeple need to wake up from the sleep. Much love to everyone ✌️",1
I thought queer meant somebody who sits down when they pee. In 7th grade during band practice my friend randomly brought up something about aiming in the bathroom and I started laughing because I thought he was kidding because I was like dude are you like 5? So they started calling me a queer. Yea. That's it.,0
Ok so for people who are still confused “queer” is basically not part of the binary system. It’s an umbrella term for people who aren’t straight and or cisgender. It’s for people who don’t feel attached to any specific label regarding their sexuality and or gender. It’s kinda similar to pansexual and bisexual. Bisexual is still apart of a binary system(one or the other) where pan is all. Queer does not necessarily mean gay. If someone identifies as queer just respect that and except it. And queer is not a slur any more than the word gay is so stop saying someone’s identity is a slur because that’s ignorant af,0
people love labels,0
So... both male and female at the same time?,0
"Ok but like, does anyone know Joon’s insta?",0

"I think a lot of modern art is faff, including a bunch of the pieces included in this video. I just see colored squares on a canvas, or splattered paint, and it does nothing for me emotionally. I also have a lot of cynicism because I perceive a lot of this modern art as money laundering, for reasons explored in the video.That said - who the hell am I to tell people who are genuinely moved by these paintings - and several of my friends are - that they're wrong? If people get something out of them, I'm glad these paintings exist. Not all art has to be for me. God knows I'm into plenty of weird shit that doesn't do anything at all for other people.",0

"I always thought of looking like art as kind of like watching the clouds. Sometimes, it is about perspective, and what you see up there will be completely different from what your friend sees, even if they're right next to you, and both of your points of veiw are very different from what you would see from up above.Sometimes, it's about objectivity, because what the clouds look like day to day can matter. They tell you things about the world around you and that can influence your day and what  your plans for it can be.Sometimes, it isn't about anything at all. Sometimes a cloud is just a cloud.",0
"art: looking at ourselves, reflected, is all i know :p and by ourselves so our imagination(s) of others. what we distill as true to their uttered intentions and our witnessed actions- among with the thoughts we discard of them, at the time of appraising and discarding. (process of negredo albedo?)coupled with more thas ineffable to my phrasings at the moment (good); art: reflections of 'ourselves as we perceive the world' --- hence, distilled to a sentence: ""watching art is a feedback loop.""? probably not an atom to isolate and make a Cartesian example out of.",0

"Now do, Is sports meaningless?Plz?",0
I love Abigail. She demonstrates these topics so well.,0
NO by no means is art meaningless and that's an argument that sets a dangerous precedent.But you know who is meaningless? Jordan Peterson.,0
"Jordan Peterson is and art snob too, he talks about this before how ""art has a million interpretations"" or ""the author is inside an spirit or force or blah blah that guides them"" i dislike it when he gets fruity and talks about art and i dont really know what to think either way. I do believe that, as Homer describes, the Muses guide the creation of art like how you wanted to write ""the prince"" but the muses wrote a story for you. and saying art has many different interpretations is BAD, imagine if a girl i don't know smiles at me am i allowed to interpret that like ""she wants to have s*x"" no i don't know that person there is context and stuff that needs to be considered. you can say ""hey your answer to 'when we go down to the nuances there is no wrong or right answer!' appears to be 'murder is still wrong' and that is disingenuous"" well you can say that you might be right but i believe in these muses that experience emotions powerful enough to pull my emotions (which is why i don't like art) but i don't think anything in existence escapes the judgment between good and bad, up and down, left and right, win and lose.",1
"I'm so confused. In thinking on art, and what qualifies as art, and how we define art as meaningful or valuable, it had me thinking on other things that are abstract but we imbue with ""value"", like fancy but impractical jewelry, or even ideals like ""justice."" From things like that to constructs like NFTs, the things only have value because we say they have value, and once people say ""no, those links to JPEGs of easily mass-produced monkeys don't have value"", then they don't anymore and the market starts crashing. But that applies to ALL of those things. So I'm left with the conclusion that the reason that ART has VALUE is the fact that it exposes the abstract artificiality of the concept of VALUE itself, and how even with value itself being a human social construct of sorts that fact does not deprive it OF that value. Simply because we say so.",0
"12:40 It's interesting that I'd agree or disagree depending on the type of art. In story-based art like plays, movies, tv shows or video games, I want there to be at least some meaning in there to give the art structure and comprehension. For all the fighting on ""ARE VIDEO GAMES ART?!"" Video games that are just art, are, ironically, lesser for it.",0

"This video was a whole bunch of nothing tbh. Art is human expression in any form, it does not have to be limited to just painting, film making or writing, it can be anything. It's a way for you to express your true self to other other people, a way to communicate ideas and feelings and genuine emotions. Sometimes you see the world differently compared to everyone else, you want to make a unique observation that provoked a thought in your head but it's hard to make others see your perspective to its fullest, so you use art as an outlet for that. It definitely has a meaning and sometimes an intended objective. The artist may not be aware of it themselves but the meaning does exist.",0
thank you for this piece &lt;3,0
This whole video felt like a huge add. Is that really your final thoughts of your exploration at the end? Maybe you should give up on philosophy if you can share so little meaning in your videos.,0

"already bringing in peterson, tim pool, etc.. already has skewed your interpretation.. and your assumptions is not interpretation.speculation and hearsay are also now concrete in the court of law.. you need evidence to back it up.. there is NO interpretation in the eyes of the law.. interpreation does not make things concret and conform to simpler understanding.. it makes it more complicated..  some of your analogies are so political taht i think you should rethink  some of your points.especailly with the bridge analogy.. much art especailly old art was tryign to recreate reality to a T.. there is so much mathematics involved..compositions , etc.. all has planning.. many artist make deliberate thoughtout strokes.. it was only impressionist that started to really go against the grain. that is the evolution of art.art has become meaningless because there is no revolt to a movement anymore.. we have reached a ppoint where it is pure monitary.. everyone can create antyhing.. not many are making art to push against the grain.. we have moved into commercial art..this is why you barely see any real massive moment anymore.. the last movement was street art.. which has been commercialized.",0

Obviously art has meaning. Every artist creates art to serve some kind of purpose it’s meaning comes from its purpose. Even if an artist try’s to create a piece of art without purpose paradoxically the lack of purpose becomes its purpose.,0

"I hate when someone talks about philosophy and knowledge and at the same time he does the most bizarre and illogical thing like transsexuality ! I mean, this man changed his gender and murderd biology, how dare he talk about science and knowledge ? This is contradictory",1
"Yes! By very design art is meaningless. Because meaning doesn't come from it but from us. To me this is one of the stupidest questions in terms of philosophy.Does that mean creating art is stupid? No! You idiot. Again, meaning is something you give. You can choose to not give it any meaning but then art is useless and that makes life boring. Is that what you want? That's why I love art! I can fully enjoy almost any piece. Whereas many people limit themselves to liking maybe up to 10 genres, at the very most 30 out of 40. I like 39 out of 40, more like 99 out of 100. I am then, as they say, easily amused. Because life is meant to be enjoyed. Celebrated even. So I celebrate it every day as I think everyone should. But I'm prolly gonna get a lot of critique for this because people love assuming the worst.See if this is any different",0
"Sorry i haven't finished many of your videos. You say something that leaves me blown away and i have to leave to think about it. But I'm back now to get through, once again, an amazing video",0
"There was some fallacious logic relying on differing meanings of the word ""about"" at the start. The example with the Titanic uses ""what is it about?"" to mean ""what is the subject?"", whereas Abi relies on the fact that ""what is it about?"" can also mean ""what is the meaning?"" to make her point about correct meanings. Just because one can be wrong about the subject of a piece of art does not necessarily mean one can be wrong about its meaning. It doesn't affect the rest of the piece, because the same point was made with the example of ""Pale Fire"", which is more intuitive as well, but it did irritate me because it seems like a cheap trick to get the audience on her side early on even though she later proved the same point without fallacious logic.",0
The artwork is always right. The viewer of the artwork is always wrong. I think this is something objectivists and subjectivists can agree on.,0

"Hehe, I guess we realize it only with oneself, being aligned heartfully and mindlessly. Something which comes instinctively natural from yourself rather than conditional (by society) which is where we often get lost.  Let's say you learn to ride a bike, well it's quite easy it's logical, methodical, mechanical and you get it but if you wanna be unique, exceptional or the best in that discipline it requires your artistic side of the whole picture. So is art meaningless? Depends on different ways the environment conditioning you and it's all in how you think. We all have an artistic side, inner sincerity &amp; devotion of that very situation will show it.",0
Art is as meaningless as life.,0
"I get it this is Philosophy Digest, But at least disclaim this path of reasoning... Things go fast and loose i'm not asking meta-commentary, nor accuracy or any other style concerns: its a very small idea that philosophy tube never makes: abstract and categorize, lol your videos are already pretty much Aristotelian in their Spirit, encyclopedic, exhaustive and discreet, it's ok not a criticism, literally every single western mind thinks with Aristotle's thinking  (Organon). It'd also do more service to philosophy by presenting ideas, concepts, theories, by their names. It's too partial to avoid saying that, and to talk about public understanding might mean repeating again that idea with each engagement. It makes it look like philosophy is some Critical Something Something Studies 15 year old discipline",0
"What Abby said about being able to tell you're wrong about art but not necessarily being able to tell if you're right... this is exactly the same in science, where you can prove something wrong pretty easily, but you can never get to 100% certainty that your model/theory (however accurate its predictions) really reflects the underlying reality.",0

"When I was in secondary school, my best friend and I used to play a game called ""artwork"" to pass the time. We'd point to an object in the room like a gas tap or a fire alarm and have to make up some sort of politically-correct citation to accompany it. It always left us in stitches because of how close we could make it sound to a genuine piece of art, just by putting some bullshit intention over the top of it. At the end of the day, we still really enjoyed it, and actually started to really appreciate the ""art"" we created, because the intention was so blatantly bullshitty, it became hilarious. I think that's why I think modern art like ""the comedian"" and ""take the money and run"" deserve to be appreciated, because sometimes the (seemingly wrong)  interpretation of a piece is what makes it enjoyable; like Pale Fire.",0

"Duchamp's urinal and anything that came from the Dada Period was a direct counter to the effects of WW1.

"I do digital art a lot, so much I injured my hand from doing it too much, and yet, I have to do it with a greater purpose. I draw characters for commission, and for my d&amp;d games. I've never drawn art not related to one of those two things, and I've even tried to draw for drawing sake, and nothing ever comes out of my pen. And when it does, it's barely sketches. I've also never understood, art for arts sake. Paintings like, the scream, all of Picassos works, I look at it all and feel, nothing at all. Of course, that's just physical art. Things like, stories, plays TV, movies, or my aforementioned d&amp;d games, which is my storytelling medium, those I understand, I understand the want to tell a story, to make someone feel something, to use different concepts in the writing to portray emotions that can't be conveyed through just explaining them, like that book mentioned about conveying the confusing nature of being trans. I myself have done this in my games, like conveying memory loss by simply, logicing out what the players character would have done, and then simply skip it. The player then gets to fully experience the concept of having lost their memory. I find it very interesting that storytelling makes perfect sense as a form of art, and yet things like immaculate paintings or carved statues, I can recognize the technique and skill needed to create that, but it doesn't make me feel anything. It gives me the exact same emotional feeling as looking at a freshly painted wall.",0

"2:10  It's possible that the paintings ""mean"" something. But It's also possible that the paintings ""do"" something.  Think of it this way: One can either try to fit the painting into one's pre-existing categories  and meanings, in which case its meaning is something you already know, and can already recognize — but just haven't sorted out yet. Or, you can allow the painting to change you. To change how you see things. If you let it. Changing, being changed, means arriving on the other shore. Gaining a new perspective. Seeing what wasn't seen before. From this new place, the usefulness of ""meaning"" diminishes, and one is left not with what something means, but what something is.",0
"There's a third way to look at the question of the clothing metaphor in MacBeth:  if it was a coincidence, would that matter?  Would that make the metaphor any less present in the final work?

"The part about planning art really GOT to me, I studied design and while im mostly an artist I have a hard time not trying to ""design"" the pieces I draw and when I realize im doing that I stop and cant really find them ""real"" anymore, Im afraid and I hate it so much.

"Seeing that room of Rothkos and just letting myself sink into them was one of my most profound museum experiences. I think all these ways of exploring meaning can be valid at different points, but I love the last part about maximizing it's value through a collective process of meaning-making. Like, let's play! Let's stack the deck in favor of this work! It's such a generous and collaborative way of ""consuming"" something that actually leaves more behind for everyone.It also does feel like there's some unknowable ""center"" to works of art. It may never be possible to know that we're right, but I almost believe in a collective unconscious lens of ""correct"" interpretation that we can intuitively sense and get closer to.",0
"45 seconds in aaaaaand you've lost me. I'm really quite tired of how little respect is afforded to subjectivist/relativistic points of view by ""analytic"" philosophers. There is no singular ""meaning"" to art; it is a message, which necessarily entails both the intention of the artist AND the experience of the audience, and its meaning is to be found in how the audience interprets that message. While the intention of the artist might be considered a matter of fact, art is not experienced as pure intention of the artist—this intention is only experienced second-hand as interpreted through the artist's chosen medium. Art is, therefore, a necessarily subjective phenomenon, since the audience's experience of art (which is constituent of its meaning) is necessarily subjective and indirect vis-à-vis the artist's intention.So, yes, I truly believe that the meaning of art is subjective. You get CLOSE to this in your discussion of Shakespeare and MacBeth, but you fall short of recognizing audience interpretation as the MEANING of art, simply relegating interpretation to a question of VALUE... and then you abandon any further inquiry for a vague mish-mash approach of 'combining the other ideas', and then you discuss the play you've written, without coming to any clear conclusion.I suppose I must not really the intended audience for your videos, if those are the sorts of bets you're making.",0

"The last book I wrote, I sent to my friend to test read and asked him point blank ""tell me what this means, because I don't know yet"" and I waited on his answer to help with the editing process, because I figured between the two of us, we could find something coherent. I then guided future drafts towards something of a more explicit meaning. But the intent was never there on the getgo; I just wanted to write a ghost story about cats. At the end of the day, what we get out of art is basically exactly what we put into it. Some people can read LOTR and simply enjoy a pair of Hobbits foiling evil; others can find the passion to write an entire dissertation. I don't think either are wrong.",0
"Haven't finished watching yet so I might edit in a bit:The Author/Auteur usually only comes into play after a critical point, when the Artist is famous, distinguished, his intentions matter greatly. He's a genius and so he should know his stuff! Lesser artists or non artists are afforded much less sovereignty over their work. If you offend your boss with an Email you can't just arbitrate yourself out of harms way that easily. Intention of course matters, you might after all manage to convince your boss, but clearly it's not all. Maybe you should've known better than calling your boss ""Bro""? I think when it comes to Interpretation what is often missed is that it's a critical function. People want to stand in front of Art like it's sacred, if it doesn't have ""great meaning"" then it's not really art, is it? But what's actually important is that you do the interpretation, it's play. So maybe it's sacrilegious to say, but Art doesn't have meaning, it's ultimately not that important. What's important is that people get to play.",0
"When I draw stuff I don't really try to interpret it. I just let other people think about what it is. I'm not an artist, but still.

But I walked into a room, and there was a Rothko next to a wonderful sea view. I stood for about 5 minutes, staring, falling into the view and the work.

"Art is not meaningless but I don't think art has meaning that can be conveyed with words. Well, some art do, but not all. Also, your opening statement was about a movie but rest of the video is about paintings. Different forms of art. Movies are stories, i.e. words. Even silent films had screenplays written with words. Although an argument can be made about the screenplays for silent films having only instructions and descriptors instead of a story. Anyway, that's beside the point. The bottomline, in my opinion, is I don't think that art - especially modern art - has meaning that needs to be, can be, nor should be expressed in words. I think a painting needs to be felt, not read nor understood. Because if the painter wanted to tell a story, they could've just wrote it (again, some art do tell a story, and thus have a ""meaning"" - like most romantic paintings for example - but I'm primarily talking about modern art).",0

"Hi Abigail!I wanted to suggest you a topic for a video.It would be about “why don’t people want to understand?”. What i mean is, it is about people who simply refuse to actually understand or learn based on evidence for X or Y topic.

They feel more comfort mentally when denying everything.",0

"My own take is that art is a study in the futility of words to capture the essence of change over time :3Where language fails, art begins ^^The reason being:Unlike maths with things like derivatives, you can’t exactly capture the exact form of one’s thought process in a coherent, digestible way. Closest we really have to my knowledge is Ulysses.Instead of a line or curve, we can only create scatter plots and timelines of what an artist may have been thinking over time. To fully understand how and why an art piece may have been made we would need the entire context in which an artist lived their life as well as how history may have morphed its meaning over time. It is impossible to predict in just one lifetime, for taking something that complex apart and understanding it often takes longer to figure out than the time that was spent creating it in the first place.",0

"I work in a museum, and we have a lot of Rothko's; I really don't connect with them at all, but a few years ago I read his book THE ARTIST'S REALITY: Philosophies of Art (published posthumously, edited by his son) which I did really connect with. Interesting, too, is how curators play into interpretation a lot - in the first few yeas of working here we had a wood sculpture, which I loved, and one day while in that gallery I met the artist, and we discussed his piece; he had a lot of uncertainty about the political aspects attached to his piece by a curator on the title card, which was not in his intention.",0

"I first became a songwriter as a way to process the emotions generated by various personal experiences.  However, I quickly became aware that many of those experiences (and resulting emotions) are largely universal.  Realizing that, my goal now is for others to understand me, while hopefully helping others to feel feel understood, too.  In fact, I specifically avoid the use of proper nouns, places, or pop culture references, so my lyrics remain as universally accessible and timeless as possible.  People who know me may hear my songs and understand exactly what they mean; others will understand my art in more general terms, based on their experiences.  Both are correct because I want listeners to bring their own baggage.Then again, I have written a song in which the lyrics are all metaphorical, telling a perfectly coherent story on their own, while actually being about something entirely different. In Blues, it's called, ""Signifying.""  The thing is, the way I wrote it, most people interpret it one way, which I intended, but only one listener has perceived the true meaning, which hides one layer deeper.",0

"I am highly sceptical of ""meaning and purpose"".  First it is often difficult to find, often because there is NO meaning and purpose to something. Second, it feeds into a religious morality. ""You MUST do this or DON""T do that, because god"". We tend to personalise everything: ""god and evil"" especially. Even working out function can be challenging enough. What drove biological evolution? people puzzled for many centuries before Darwin and Wallace worked out a testable mechanism. This was partly because people jumped to ""purpose"" before working out how function came about. The ""god-creator"" idea was never really a good one, because it degenerated into endless speculation. Was god infinite in space and time? Who created the ""creator-god"", and other unanswerable questions. Worse, they were UNTESTABLE questions. And it is not as if we couldn't come up with a decent moral system without a god or religious tradition. Just based on facts. We are [for the most part] cognitive social apes that can detect, and relate to, sufferings in others. So to have a functional and safe society, things like violence and murder are dysfunctional for individuals, and societies. And are you a moral agent, if you just refrain from murdering someone because some ""magic man in the sky is going to punish or reward you based on your behaviours?""""Purpose"", even in biology, is highly suspect. There are males and females, is the purpose of genitals for reproduction? Yes, mating can be a function that promotes the creation of offspring, but humans and other organism use sex for all sorts of things. And they all seem to get by somehow by having homosexual, bisexual or whatever behaviours from time to time. ""Symptoms"" get conflated with ""causes"".  Why not accept sex and gender as something that ""just is"". ? But no, if someone is ""non-binary"" the ""sex is just for reproduction"" [function] means that those who do not indulge in sex for reproduction are, at best, seen as ""dysfunctional"", and at worst, evil, and something to be abused or destroyed. So, at least 99% of the time, ""purpose and meaning"" is not only horseshit, but harmful horseshit. My two cents anyway.",0

"99,9% of artists intention falls into 3 categories: A) create something that the artist likesB) make something that others enjoyC) I need to buy food, so I need money, so I need to do something.

"""Is art meaningless"" would be a stupid question if it wasn't actually a tactically destructive question use to waste people' s time. But that tactic is to be expected of a post 1945 culture of endless faux-rebel newbie Dadaist that infest the world with their fear of definite choices.People who ask this question: are people who want art to have no meaning, or a single meaning that stable exists through out all time. They are also people who hate history and context and thinking Art Suffers from an abidance of meaning.Art Suffers from an abidance of meaning.Art Suffers from an abidance of meaning.That is why all people who make art can't really talk about it. It is because they want to maximize the work's ability to keep people thinking about it. There was a meme about a person complaining about how people shouldn't discuss the colour of the curtains. Yet in the bible, god dictate the detail what color the dressing of the tabernacle should be.People when they like an art work will find huge amount of meaning in the smallest things.Or at least what they interpret as ""small things"" because people who hate history don't understand how one colours could have tons of meanings. Such as flags, royalty clothing, sports teams and bodily fluids. It is not so much ""does art have meaning,"" but which groups subscribe what meaning to a work.A correct meaning is nothing more than having a group of people agree with that meaning. And when different groups have different meanings they have to gibberish up their meaning to make sure they don't go to war.This is why reality is slippery.  It's a collection of meanings the come from certain groups. Ultimate the meanings of art are boring, and really it's the group that creates the meaning, and if a person knows a group well enough, then one can predict their boring reactions.Much how the use of Picasso was miss-read. The people didn't have two mouths; they would have one mouth to the side and the eyes looked straight at the viewer. The goal of cubeism was to present different perspectives at the same time on a 2d plane The Curtains were purple. Those with access to history know that purple was a very hard colour to make, which why it represented royalty.",0
"So I think the artists intent is not so important, more over I'd say you can somewhat objectively, if only for a time, determine if art is good or bad. I'd say when 1,000 people look, feel, or experience art in its many forms, and most come to the same conclusion, that is objectively good art, even if the consensus is that it's bad. When they come to many different conclusions I'd say its bad art.Edit: I'd like to debate this idea.",0

"I absolutely love Edward Hopper's paintings and I was very surprise most people find them sad.

If it means something to them, whatever this is, then I did my job well. Meanings and feelings is the number one reason for a sale, not the objective ""quality"" / level of technique / hours I put in.",0

But I think the best art either almost makes you forget that it is art, makes you forget about yourself, or makes you so immersed in it that you can't, or don't want to, hold another thought at the same time. It puts you on a constructive or a cathartic path, whether you know if you get it or not, you get something from it.",0

You are inspirational.I'm a songwriter and poet and my view has always been that each song or poem should mean whatever the reader or listener deems it to.

"I like the indeterminacy argument towards the singular. The artist may denote their meaning on it and may grow to develop a new meaning as years go on. This is the same with the general publics reaction to it. A lot of the context is lost and too intellectualised which is why Sontag's remark about just experiencing the art has a significant weight. This also brings in the indeterminacy of the individuals ideas, aesthetics and conceptual analysis of what we mean by ""meaning"". If it is contextual then the artist saying it is x means it is x. Postmodern art theory showed it was more about what the audience wants it to mean. (Barthes - killing the author - giving rise to postmodern critiques) The immeasurable wealth of what Rothko means to the person is weighed against what he said it does. Art does let people interpret new things, and it always will. Meaning is not value.",0

"i love art. it can appear so useless. but it can also change your view of the world. or document ideas of time periods. but i mostly interact with art by looking at it. i don’t think or try to interpret it, i look at it.but it‘s fun to try to interpret it, so i sometimes do that too. but for me, the first is an inherently ‚alone‘ experience and interpreting is more fun doing with more than one person. i don‘t really care what the artist intended. i think the moment the artist shares it, they have lost the right for the right interpretation. so sometimes i read what the artist intended, so that the artist can ‚be that second person with whom you interpret it‘. but i don’t give their interpretation any more weight than anyone elses interpretation. i think you can also learn a lot about the person you are looking at the art with, by listening to their interpretation, and that‘s always interesting. i also love looking at things that weren’t ‚intended‘ to be art. i think everything can be art and i like seeing the world as art. i also think it’s a pity when people say they know ‚the right interpretation‘ because they loose so many interesting thoughts that way.",0

"I do photography as a hobby, and from the very beginning I have never once intended or tried to ""mean"" anything with my art. I have always only and exclusively wanted to make pictures that are aesthetically pleasing. I find it freeing, because that way I don't actually have to think about what I'm doing and how I can get the art to push the beholder into my meaning and rather just go with my intuition of what looks good, nice, beautiful. I see a nice parallel to the point of Stop thinking, Start enjoying there.",0

"George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead is the first zombie movie, released in 68', only four years after the civil rights act. The plot is simple. The dead suddenly come back and crave the flesh of the living, and various survivors barricade themselves in a remote house, but the numbers of the undead around the house are constantly increasing and tensions between the survivors are rising. In the end, only our main character remains alive. Ben; risking his life for others on multiple occasions and standing up to a toxic, cowardly and authoritarian wife beater throughout the movie. A group of previously introduced armed guys led by a mayor hunting for zombies approach the house. Ben heard gunshots and looks out the window, assuming rescue is here. ""There is one"" one of the men says, pointing at Ben. A few seconds later, Ben falls to the ground, he's been shot in the head. ""That's another one for the pile"" they say, and use meat hooks to drag his body to be burned together with dozens of zombie corpses.Ben is played by a black man. Romero said that he didn't intend any racial themes while writing, Duane Jones, Ben's actor, simply gave the best performance at the auditions. Some art can speak on it's own.",0

"So glad you featured Rothko’s Seagram Murals. They are particularly challenging. I’ve always subscribed to James Joyce’s ideas on art as expressed by his character Stephen Daedalus in The Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man; “—In the same way, said Stephen, your flesh responded to the stimulus of a naked statue, but it was, I say, simply a reflex action of the nerves. Beauty expressed by the artist cannot awaken in us an emotion which is kinetic or a sensation which is purely physical. It awakens, or ought to awaken, or induces, or ought to induce, an esthetic stasis, an ideal pity or an ideal terror, a stasis called forth, prolonged, and at last dissolved by what I call the rhythm of beauty.” For me, it is that aesthetic stasis, that suspended apprehension which bypasses the intellect and it’s need to interpret art that is essential. The Seagram Murals provide that. Sit with them, contemplate them, don’t try and interpret or make sense of them and they’ll open to you.",0
"People that use air quotes tickle me because they make me think they are doltish but in your case it is funny because you are being sarcastic, ironic and most of all mean with the best of intentionality. Anyways in art all is possible. Intentionality at best ends being an icberg frozen in time and space but as time itself ages the art and kills of the artist intentionality becomes a mean of erasing what is the true nature of artistic expression. David Mamet intentiuonality is that of an angry Jew who wants to get even with the inhumanity that surrounds his petty second rate Jordan Peterson (and Jordan Petersen is third rate to begin with which is as close a compliment that Mamet deserves). What matters in art is serendipity. Not just in the act of creation by the artist but in its 'interpretation appreciation and denounciation' by those that would do so. Rothko to me is just a suicidal hot mess that wanted to get under peoples skin by depressing the fuck out of them. Most artist are outsiders with a chip on their shoulder or unresolved traumas and irreconcialable hatreds and unattainable loves. So they toil in the making and as they make serendipidously truth beauty emerges. Thanks for making think about what the hell i am doing making art for. It is not for the money nor for the reknown or to even get laid, the doing somehow has all of those rewarding our souls in an ""abstract expressionistic' manner that has me completely unawares of what the hell I am talking about. All human beings now have only one choice and that is to become as great an artist as one is able to and all of us must do our best to see all of it and bear it witness. To do less dooms us to an extinction of the soul, culture and raison d'etre. I wonder if I can now use airquotes as my mantra? If I gesture airquotes while asking if a tree falls down in the forrest does it make a sound, will the airquotes make its own swishy sound? Anyways congradulations with your lesbianism and yes I would like to watch that sometime in a post modernist sort of way.

"In English, one assignment we had was to analyze two works about the same place, one by an artist, one by a scientist, we weren't told that, I assumed the one by a poet was some dry science thing, and found the one by the science guy a fun and interesting piece of art",0
"Art is a really fun topic! I think it is honestly great to ""misinterpret"" a work of art, to find different ways it could be read based on what exists in the work itself. It's very fun to hold multiple ideas to be true about a work of art. My favorite example of this is Icon For Hire's ""Supposed to Be"", much of their discography revolves around struggle with mental illness and ""Supposed to Be"" is about the anxiety of navigating identity when recovering from mental illness as it takes up so much of your identity that one can feel naked without it. However mental illness in the work can be substituted with dysphoria, where many people view gender dysphoria as the basis of their transness and worry about who they are without it.Art is also driven by audiences, what a person thinks about it is just as important as what an author ""intends"" (which is in itself their own interpretation of the work). It is also impossible to account for every possible viewer and their experiences that changes the meaning of the artwork to themself.",0
disagree,0
"This was a great video, and I’ve always thought art interpretation is very interesting, because from my perspective I’m always far more interested in what others think my art is about than what I think. I can’t speak for other artists but most of the time I get an image in my head or in a dream and then I make it real, in that sense, I almost need other people to explain my art to me. It has always been my opinion that most art is autobiographical and speaks to the life the artist lived when they created it. As artist we can try imbuing meaning in our work but ultimately it’s just another way of trying to communicate. When I first got into art it was because if felt like their were things I couldn’t say or verbalize, I’d spent my life trying to become as articulate as possible but no matter how precisely you convey your opinion or experience, that will always be filtered through the lens’s of other peoples experience. To me the first time I really started making art it felt like I was able to say the things that I always wanted to with the freedom of not worrying if other people “got” me. That’s what makes art so beautiful to me, the freedom of expression and the balance of interpretation",0

"I’m big into hiking. When I get to a vantage where I can see the landscape around me, I’m often struck by the aesthetic experience, as I might be by a work of art. The colors and textures and sound and air, are all very powerful to me. They mean something to me, something about life as a force, and the beauty of harmony in a complex system, and the true scale of space and time in the universe that humanity is embedded in like a splinter. At the same time, I’m very aware that there is no intention present in the landscape, no artist. This is just what the world looks like, and has always looked like, since long before artistic intent existed here. Or perhaps, the universe as a whole is the artist. I often find myself comparing my experiences of human art to this one, and tend to see a lot of art through this comparison. I don’t think I have anything special to conclude from this, except that I think art can be everything you said in the video and even more. I don’t generally worry about “getting it”, except as a medium of understanding between me and someone I care about. To me, art is an iceberg, and there is no way for a single human to perceive or understand it entirely. Art is a part of us, as we are a part of it, and no system can describe and justify its own existence.",0

"One interesting thing about art is how the addition of later art decontextualised it. When Fearless Girl was erected on Wall Street in juxtaposition to the pre existing Charging Bull statue, it could be interpreted as a feminist statement against patriarchy. But the sculptor of Charging Bull was understandably angry because it changed the meaning of his statue, originally meant as a sign of America’s resilience, to one embodying sexism. But then there’s the extra complication that Fearless Girl was commissioned by a trillion dollar Wall Street Index fund that explicitly advertises the company, whereas charging bull was an act of guerilla art that the artist (an immigrant) never sold, in some ways making the fearless girl more of an expression of capitalist priceless than the bull.",0
"I have my own view on an artwork's meaning.Art is a process. That process may or may not have an intended direction or destination, however it is influenced by the experiences and thought processes of the artist. As is with the artist, the observer has their own thoughts and experiences that shape the way they view the world. It is through one's own understanding of the world that we find meaning.Anyone can share their own interpretation, even the artist. Some seek comfort in knowing theirs is the same. The true meaning is the one we see when we are true to ourselves, not the opinions of others.",0

"RE meaning, intention, and the subjective experience (and how the external social experience affects them), from the perspective of an Opera-majored Music &amp; Linguistics double-degreed viewer:  The final moments of Act IV of Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro are written on the page as a woman conferring forgiveness upon her cheating husband. However, there are aspects of both the objective writing and the subjective interpretation by the director of production (which are well-known to scholars of this masterwork, so much so that it's near standardized, expected in production) that are...seem....clear indications that this moment is really one of God/deity conferring forgiveness upon the human animal. The expectation of knowledge of this subjective interpretation is so great that there's an additional expectation upon the producer/director of creating that subjective experience, and a failure to do so is a kind of social malpractice because it strips the work of its (expected) meaning. EX: In one of my experiences of viewing the opera (after having studied and performed in it and seen it produced by exceptional companies), I saw a production by a smaller company with a less-educated audience (NB: By this I mean that there was no output by the company, no lectures nor programs for the audience), in which the director ignored or was unaware of the known interpretation (or did something intentional that was cruel, even emotionally abusive), and this seemed a dereliction (or willful malfeasance) of duty to the creation of the piece that adhered to its true meaning:  In Act II, in the middle of a brilliant and hilarious dispute, the Count asks forgiveness for his actions from his wife. Here, the director arranged a series of events in which the Count finally knelt down in a certain way to do this; it was funny; it should have been (if we read Mozart's work on the page, which are more objective at this moment in the opera). But in the more profound moment at the end of Act IV  (by subjective opinion, albeit an agreed-upon one), in which the moment was coming, and the music was predicting this moment (there is a written rest, a silence, and in that moment, the direction is for the Count to kneel), I had opened myself up for that spiritual experience, the forgiveness, but the director had chosen for the Count kneel down before the Countess in the exact way he had in Act II...and the audience laughed; where forgiveness should have been, there was laughter. In that moment, in which the socially-agreed-upon, expected interpretation of this work of art was altered by the director...I felt violated...because my subjective experience of the art was something so expected, and the director, intentional or not, turned it into something else. Here, while my subjective experience of a work of art is my own, my interpretation is the widely-accepted and educated one, and the interpretation of a director/producer of the art was not only contradictory, but contradictory in a way that defied what objective clues we have from the written work and the social agreement about the meaning of that moment, so that the director's interpretation was emotionally and spiritually harmful. There was a social responsibility that the director violated by, intentionally or not, mis-/re-interpreting that moment. Here, meaning, and the social agreement about meaning where objective evidence might be lacking, was part of the social experience of the art.",0
"I'm an illustrator and writer. I went to an arts university focused on conceptual art, and hated it. We learned nothing, very few teachers were competent and we were doing all the time trash because they didn't teach us any technique or skill. We had a teacher that literally made us do a sculpture project with trash, I had another sculpture teacher that didn't let me do any figurative project because she didn't know anatomy sho she couldn't correct any mistakes if there were.I made a lot of shit and learned to ""sell "" it by adding some made up phylosophical nonsense about the hidden meaning of the piece (and I love phylosophy but it was nonsense, and teachers liked it).There are some conceptual art I can like for pure aesthetic or as a curiosity, but as an artist, to me most of it is just made-up pretentious hollow nonsense to sell.

"There's a song from Joan Manuel Serrat called ""princesa"". It's about a mother who worries about her daughter because she wants her to have a better life than she had. It's sang from the pov of the mother, who tells her child that she must be well behaved and well dressed, and that she must refrain from hanging out with the other girls and boys in town, who have no aspirations and will must probably end up as poor as their parents. The song ends with the daughter leaving the house for an audition for a tv show.My boss showed me this song and expressed that he felt the song was heartwarming, because it showed the love of the mother towards her daughter. I, on the contrary, felt it was heartbreaking, because this woman puts so much pressure on her daughter and even alienates her from her friends, only for the expectation that she will have a career as an actress. All this without knowing that the TV and film industries are very exploitative and that incoming actresses have to go through an immense amount of sexual harassment and abuse to get their first role.I don't know what the author's intention was, but the artwork touched me and my boss in very different ways. Maybe the point of art is not to ""get it"", but to feel it. It is not the artwork itself what's valuable, but the interaction between it and us, even between it and the author.

Hotel expressionists walk out the lift and on checking out pay for their art.""The song is talking about vandalising hotel rooms in unique and creative ways, but it considers this to be a very pure form of art as you're not interested in its worth; the cost of the art can be easily calculated from the damage caused.

It would certainly creat a dramatic affect, and change the art work's emotional impact on the viewer. Will it also change its meaning? Will it, in effect, creat a new art work? If someone produces Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice with Shylock as the pov protagonist - are they still ""doing Shakespear""? Or are they commenting on it with something new?",0
"pog video. the thing that interests me that i feel is left out is what the viewer(s) of art brings to the experience.  one might decide that the best way to experience rothko is to empty your mind of other thoughts and focus on the colours and perhaps that is what you are invited to do by the gallery. but it's a choice your making and there are other choices too, as the video details. If an artwork itself has meaning, then so too must the lens of interpretation through which the work is experienced. but that means there is something in the ""value"" or ""meaning"" or ""interpretation"" of art that  does not reside in the artwork alone, nor in the viewer's subjective experience, but which emerges as part of this dialectic working out.this sounds like wankery but honestly I think it's actually pretty intuitive when we actually engage with art. when I sit down to watch 3 hours of shakespeare I'm alert to different aspects of the experience than i would be if I was watching 3 hours of marvels avengers. I decide I can get the most out of avengers by drinking 5 beers and going ""ooh"" and ""aah"" when hulk smashes. For Macbeth I'm more attentive to the use of language and the performances of the actors. My choices here are influenced by the content of the works, but do not pass judgment on it. And similarly, the content is produced under the assumption that it can be judged in certain such ways. I guess another way to put it would be to say that it's a like dialogue between the artwork and the viewer. And they don't necessarily speak the same languages. And translating between languages may cause divergences in the conversation. Or it may break down entirely. You might think the artwork is asking you ""how are you feeling?"" or ""would you like to see hulk smash?"" or ""What if there were too many genders?"" and depending on the artwork in question you may be satisfied or not. But depending on the artwork, you also intuit that some questions are more apposite than others. Does this mean there is no ""correct"" meaning/interpretation of art? yes i think so - since it is ultimately rooted in the subjective experience of the individual, the scope of meaning that can reside solely in the artwork itself is as untamed as human experience. But that doesn't mean that any meanings you find are entirely arbitrary or inexplicable. That feeling that an interpretation is ""wrong"" doesn't make sense in reference to the artwork alone, but it might make sense in the wider scope of socially constructed meanings that you perceive it to belong to. You can have any heterodox interpretation you like, and if you find it to be valuable then more power to you, but if you want to take your experience and share it then you will need to have some means of communicating that - a communication that would probably break down into confusion if you tried something like reviewing Dr Strange as if it was actually Titanic. But by the same token, I think any entirely personal reason you have for valuing an artwork (like there being a nice reminder of alfred molina) is a valid part of the experience and shouldn't be entirely discounted. I don't know which philosophers this view aligns with, but I'm definitely of the opinion that worrying about the objective meaning of an artwork only really makes sense if you have a constrained view of what the actual process of experiencing art is.",0

"I’ll just throw in my two cents. Is “meaning” an intrinsic attribute of art? Or rather, should it be?It seems to me that the main criticism of modern art is the fact that it bases its value (let’s call it that) on meaning rather than its objective beauty (or lack thereof).If you look back on other artistic periods, for example neoclassicism, they took inspiration from Greek and Roman art not because it had some meaning, but because it was beautiful. Sure, they attributed certain values like reason and enlightenment to the art, but the main reason they copied Greek and Roman art mainly because of their beauty. So one could argue that neoclassical art had meaning because it was beautiful, whereas modern art presents itself as being beautiful because it has meaning.I think you can’t base art on meaning, you must base its meaning on the art itself.I’m not a Marxist, I don’t agree with Marx on most things, but I will allow myself to use some of his philosophy to make a point. One of the criticisms Marx had towards his teacher Hegel was that Hegelian philosophy was based on the assumption that the world was a manifestation (or antithesis) of an idea or spirit (or thesis). Marx refuted this because according to him, reality could not simply be born out of some mystical idea. Only the real, physical world is real, and one can’t consider an abstract world as real.If we apply this concept to art, we find that the intention or idea of an artist simply cannot be considered art, because ideas are abstract. Only the work itself is concrete and thus real, so any meaning is subjective and by Marxist philosophy not admitted.If you read Paul Valery’s treaty on artistic creation, he says that “art is nothing more than a thing in itself”, and that a good reading of the art can improve the quality of a poor product and vice versa.If art bases its value on meaning, it means that the “work of art” doesn’t exist in itself but rather in the head of who’s observing it, and the art disappears once the viewer moves their attention away from it; viceversa, a work of art done for the sake of beauty (or art that claims to have value not because of its meaning but simply because of it’s physical self) exists irrespective of its viewer.The former will cease to exist once the mentality of people changes, whereas the latter will stand the test of time.“The fountain” will cease to exist as a work of art if enough people stop thinking of it as a work of art and see it as a simple urinal, they will throw it away, whereas no matter how much the mentality of a society changes, “The Birth of Venus” will still be a beautiful painting of a woman on a seashell being given life by an angel, “Amor and Psyche” will still be a romantic depiction of two bodies kissing.Which brings me to another and final point.Modern art, or rather art that bases itself on meaning rather than physical beauty, is also based on elitism and classism. If you must know the meaning of a work of art to appreciate it, you have to follow a specific school of thought, meaning that those who do not follow said school of thought are excluded from that work. And maybe you can’t follow that school of thought because you don’t have the time or resources to inform yourself about it, so now that art is just an inside joke of a small, elitist (and sometimes condescending) circle. Art that bases itself on its physical beauty, however, is open to everyone and anyone, as it is an immediate message that does not require any particular education.",0

"I took AP art in high school concentrating on insects. I showed off my work in my schools annual public art show, and a little kid said something I still think about when he looked at my pieces. “It’s like you live in a giant world!”My intention of my concentration was to lessen the fear of insects by bringing them up close in a way that the audience could feel safe (as opposed to showing live insects). I didn’t mean to make him feel small like that, but that was out of my control. And his comment brain blasted me and made me feel the same way because I really do live on in an unimaginably big world filled with creatures I’ll never get to see anywhere but in pictures.",0

"When I look at that red painting with the black lines I just feel… bored? Maybe a little confused. Sometimes wonder if I’m just missing the part of my brain that makes me capable of enjoying really abstract pieces of art? I guess it really depends on the specific work but most of them leave me feeling.. Indifferent? And that’s not because I’ve resigned myself to believing “it’s not real art” and starting out with the goal of disliking it. I want to get it and see what I’m missing, but I just don’t get anywhere. There was that one scientific study that compared abstract paintings and paint throw at a canvas by Chimpanzees that found the majority of people could tell the difference. I must be one of those who can’t. Recently I visited the Louvre, and I saw countless pieces of expertly made, beautiful art.. But there were only three works that actually made me feel anything other than “oh, that’s cool.” The first was the palace of King Darius I, which doesn’t count because I was just filled with the kind of excitement youd get when meeting a celebrity, as I had read about him for a history paper. The second was a painting of a man who was holding his dead wife after returning from exile, and the artist captured the shock, grief, and loss in his eyes in a way that it made me those things too. But that wasn’t abstract, so that doesn’t really count either. There was one piece, that was hanging above a staircase, that’s the only abstract art that’s ever made me feel before. It was a silhouette of a person, almost like an aura, laying in the dirt while staring up at the night sky full of stars. It made me feel wonder, but at the same time weirdly trapped? Like there was all this beauty out there in the world, but like the figure I was just stuck in the dirt, doomed to watch it from a distance. It captured that mixture of awe and nihilistic dread you get when you think about yourself in relation to the scale of the universe - there’s all that out there, and you’re just dirt. I still wonder why that one connected with me when all these other works just make me think “Ooh, those are fun squiggly blue lines”.",0
"wild that most people see the seagram murals as sad. to me they're objects of bloodthirst and danger, looking at an angry gorilla through thick glass. the only reason the canvas has not torn itself from the wall, folded to razor sharp ribbons, and mangled me, is that the laws of physics constrain it.",0

"the doctor strange opening argument is quite flawed. Not to be a dick but missing the plot and missing the meaning are not the same. The plot and what its about is not subjective, the meaning behind it and what the moral is, is.what you did was the equivalent of going to a red painting and then telling your friend ""it was the best green painting ive ever seen"". You stated something that is objectively wrong.Now ,if you were asked ""whats the message, whats the point"" you could say nearly anything and be right ad also wrong. Art is subjective, the meaning and take away can be anything.(which to be fair, you kind of went into in the second part)",0
"unless if it has some practical or medicinal use, art is meaningless.",0
"The same high quality and fantastic discussion as always, thank you Abigail. Still, one thing I had expected you to discuss but didn't see was the extent to which a lot of art, especially modern art, is part of a conversation between artists. To an extent, we are interlopers listening to an exchange to which we are only incidentally involved. My favourite example is to consider how to interpret René Magritte's ""Perspective II, Manet's Balcony"", if you were not familiar with Manet's ""The Balcony"" first. Of course this also applies very explicitly to Duchamp's Fountain that you discuss in the video.",0
"The strange thing about meaning is, it's at the same time subjective and objective. You are born into a world where words are defined in a dictonary, and you have to adopt them. Then again you are using language to express your needs, feelings and desires. I think by interpreting art you cannot get to a place, where everything is resolved, every single tension realeased. There will always be a certain doubt, but that doesn't mean that you can't approach this place.",0
"Beautiful work, Abby. I think this one is a new fave for me",0
"No it's not meaningless. Not inherently. Art is expression and storytelling and everything that enriches our lives somehow without needing to be ""useful""",0
"I really needed this kind of exploration. I'm finally getting the first opportunity as a painter to create something special in a long time, but so removed and lost from that world that I can't think up a concept. Of all things to get the conceptual mind flowing, I actually went straight to your back log of philosophy content that has taught me so much over the years, and seemingly by fate you put out this piece specifically about philosophising art. You have immeasurably helped an artist today Abi, keep up the amazing work you do 💙",0
"So this is gonna be my take on the title before I watch the video, and I'll come back to it when I finish the vid. If you're reading the Abigail, the video is probably very well made and brings up some important points I didn't consider. So anyway I think that art is only meaningless if you decide that it should be so. What I mean by that is a piece of art can have very wildly different meanings depending on who it reaches and the person who is viewing the art. For example, one person can look at a song and recognize very deep themes about mental illness and about child abuse or neglect, and another can hear the same song and simply think ""oh hey, Pumped Up Kicks is pretty catchy, let's put that on our school radio show"". I think that a piece of art can be made with the express purpose of delivering one message, and can transform into new life as time passes and a variety of people all look at it and express their individual thoughts about it, sort of how people take cartoon characters and turn them into lgbt icons. An important caveat to this though is that because a piece of art can mean different things to different people, a piece of art can easily be weaponized against certain groups in society, even if the piece of art itself is originally unrelated to the oppressive movement. However, the piece of art itself does not do anything on it's own, other than be perceived, interpreted, and shared by people. In conclusion to this super informal essay, what I'm trying to say is that a piece of art only has meaning when you the individual ascribes meaning to it, and you the individual will always be free to simply avoid giving art meaning or to delve as deeply into a piece of art and it's history and potential meaning as you wish, so long as you are respectful of other people's ability to do the same. Thanks for coming to my TED talk.Edit: aight I watched the video and I was right, lots of very important discussion here I'd say. The part about that artist who admitted he was a fraud and then went into nfts was pretty ironic, and art as a vehicle for wealth totally slipped past me when I was originally formulating my thoughts on the subject. I tried to limit how much I touched on artist intention myself, because whole I think that the intent of the author definitely shapes the way that art is perceived, in the sense that the author gives you the stimulus from which your brain makes connections, the author still does not have complete control over how an audience can or will experience it. To use a mixed up metaphor, you can paint a wall green, but you can't keep a colorblind person from seeing red. One thing I noticed was that there is a distinction between what a piece of art is about and the meaning of the art? Like, if you were to interpret the meaning of art to be the lesson that you take away from it, or the message that the art conveys/ is meant to convey (augh, im contradicting myself. Hear me out, I have a good point in here somewhere) In that case, you would say that Titanic was about some people on a boat that find love and have it be abruptly interrupted by an iceberg, but the meaning of it would be that ""the greatest moments of our lives are often fleeting and don't last for very long, so enjoy them while they last and live in the present, not the past"" or something like that. Anyway, great video Abby, your costumes are great and your punchlines were greater. Keep up the good work!",0

"You put into words what I've been thinking about for some time now. As an artist I'm always thinking about how to put meaning into my art, that reflects how I see things.

It never made sense to me but now I realize that just because people interpret things subjectively it doesn't mean that the meaning itself is subjective. Love your videos, have a nice day.",0
"My greatest experience of art was seeing Rothko in London while listening to Daughters' ""You Won't Get What You Want."" I just sat there, though the whole album, and felt swallowed. By life, by the concept of existence, by the paintings and the music. I had a panic attack, but it felt profound in a way that is hard to express.",0
"In highschool, after never having taken an art class before, I joined the International Baccalaureate Art class at my school. I had started making a piece/doing research about how people ""poopoo"" artists like Rothko and Jackson Pollock and how myself and the average person doesn't ""get it"" and it can feel meaningless. But, as I began researching more about the art pieces like Rothko's, seeing how intentionally large and vast they are (which is a completely different experience from just seeing small 1 inch large pictures on Google images or in low quality print ) and began thinking more about the emotional reaction that one can experience from art, I began to understand the art more and learned to love and appreciate them.To me I think art can be seen like furniture. There's a huge spectrum that fulfills multiple purposes from mass produced works to homemade sentimental pieces, custom originals to art market million dollar pieces sold as stocks and tax loopholes. Art's meaning can be decorative, emotional, political, financial, expressive, sentimental, educational, entertainment, trendiness, aesthetic, nostalgic, ectEveryone has their own tastes, enjoys different styles, and comes with their own experiences to art. The subjective. An artist may have an explicitly clear intention with a piece, or not at all, and it's up to the viewer if they interpret the art in a common way or not. Like with furniture where forms and expectations such as a handle commonly alludes to function (such as with a drawer), one can choose the interpretation of furniture (and art's) functions. One could store clothing in an oven or make soup in a bathtub, counterintuitive to social norms and designer expectations, they are nonetheless valid as functions for the furniture's user.Like how John Green says ""books belong to their readers"", no one person has an identical experience with art. One can learn more about the artist's intention, context and design of art works to attempt to get a closer semblance of the common interpretation the artist seeks to convey, just like how furniture can come with instruction manuals, but it's up to each individual if they choose to ""read the manual"", how much research they plan to do for each piece, and how much they combine or ignore their individual interpretation based on the knowledge they acquire surrounding the art.",0

"There is an example I can think of where the author's intent and the actual text of a work ended up completely different from each other.Book of Mario 64 is a romhack of the original Paper Mario game that keeps the gameplay mostly unchanged, but has a completely new story. The game is set in a universe with multiple competing pantheons whose power depends on the number of adherents to their respective religions. When Browser, a deity in the religion of Kuba, discovers that he is gay and in love with Mario, despite currently being in a heterosexual marriage with the Star of Rodin, the god of Kuba, Mario is thrust into the ongoing religious conflict. The game has symbolism, one of my favorite plot twists in any piece of media, and consistent characters who develop over time. The only problem is, it was written entirely by Google Translate. Specifically, the game was made by the youtuber Fatguy706 and a team of his friends, who would take the original text from Paper Mario, translate it through various languages until the accumulated translation errors transformed the original line into something completely different, then pasted the result back into the game. If Google Translate's intent determines the game's meaning, then the plot should be read as identical to the original Paper Mario, as Google Translate's intent is to provide flawless machine translation. If you argue that the team who made the hack are the writers, then following their attempt still doesn't work, since they were trying to replicate an earlier, far more comedy-focused hack of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door that was made in a similar way, and were not trying to synchronize the lines in any way to form a story. In practice, the way the story got interpreted was like a collective version of the ""whatever makes it work the best for you"" school of art interpretation.",0

The book highlighted a certain way of thinking, saying that the Mona Lisa wasnt art, but Duchamp’s version of Mona Lisa with a mustache drawn on it was.  Why?  Intention.  Mona Lisa was painted as a commissioned work, not to evoke feelings, so it wasn’t “really” art.  Nothing painted to exhibit skill, nor anything created as a cultural artifact for a purpose other than “to be art”, SHOULD be considered art.  That argument has stuck with me.

"Art is self-simulation of our senses for entertainment. It is inherently masturbatory.Stroking our own emotions off. Jacking one's own imagination. Art is to abstract communication as what a date with Rosie Palms is to our physical sensory channels.Our brains are capable of communicating meaning abstractly and art exploits that capability by trying to pile on as much ""meaning"" as possible, even if that meaning is entirely fabricated and has zero relevance to reality. It's the shadows and echoes of meaning. A cascade of hypothetical questions left INTENTIONALLY unanswered - as teasing BULLSHIT like ""we leave this equation unsolved as an exercise for the reader"" yeah whatever fuck you too textbook.Then your pattern recognition and problem solving processes get to propose a bunch of potential jigsaw pieces that may hypothetically fit the gap in the puzzle WITHOUT EVER ACTUALLY COMPLETING IT because again, it's a TEASE.

"After watching this video and remembering my experiences when exposed to art, I'm reaching to a conclusion, even if you didn't talk exactly about it. When I look at pictures in a museum I used to be always frustrated that next to it, it only mentions the technique, when I looked for the artist's insight. I find very attractive to feel the art, but most of the modern art works don't make me feel anything. I've remembered some instances when I did feel things, and it was when I was given some information about the piece - apart from ""óleo sobre lienzo"" 😅. For example, there was a sculpture next to my flat, which formed kind of a huge sphere-like with a lot of gaps. It never made me feel anything. Once I had a friend visit me who knew about modern art, and she told me that it wasn't about the material in the sculpture, that it's about the space it created or something like that - it was years ago. And that made me look at it differently, it made me enjoy it for the first time. So maybe it isn't about ""the meaning"" for me, about ""getting it"". But I still think that, in most cases, I need something more than the art work itself to be able to have some type of esthetic experience.",0
"I worked for a small town art exhibit center, back in the summer of 2020, and there was this exhibit of very beautiful porcelain sculptures upstairs. They were organic in a sort of morbid kind of way, and I definitely felt the ""fragility of life"" aspect through being constantly nervous that the visitors might break something...one of the pieces was this series of three porcelain skulls, each with a different amount of dead flowers stacked up on their heads. It was called ""vanities,"" or something like it. My boss, and many people, spent a lot of time going on at length about the meaning of the piece, and I was honestly starting to feel like it was all a bit performative and pretentious, until one day a young girl was visiting, maybe nine or ten, and she just sort of looked at the skulls, and, softly, said ""I think the flowers represent their thoughts,"" and it gave me a whole new appreciation of the work, because I'd never seen it that way. No one had said that before, but once she said it, it felt obvious. It was a good, fresh take. The artist herself much preferred talking about the process of experimenting with her medium than explaining the meaning of her works, and frankly, that is very much a valid way to make art, in my opinion. Maybe the main sin of interpretation is just like the main sin of art: a refusal, conscious or unconscious, to engage in an emotionally honest attempt to express our experiences. Suggested interpretations and artist intent help us construct meaning, but at the end of the day, I think there is only ever something interesting to say about art when we feel like our experience of it, unintended as it may be, genuinely matters.",0

"As a black man, I can confirm that the play Race, hits quite a bit different. For context, I did my undergrad in history and do have a fair academic history background as a result. Additionally, one of my favorite books of all time is ‘The Storytelling Animal’ by Jonathan Gottschall. The book focuses on the question of why the otherwise ruthless process of evolution left storytelling in, since it seems ‘unnecessary’ to some thinkers. It’s not strictly utilitarian in the way other more obvious traits are.My theory is that storytelling, and art generally, is a way for a group to not only reinforce expectations about in-group behavior between members, but also control associations made between groups. Major groundwork of colonialism was made by ostensibly ‘entertainment’ products from Europeans at the time linking dark skinned peoples with tribalism, backwards thinking, and inferiority. Art here served the social function of linking European aesthetics with legitimacy, and everything else as less legitimate, inferior or unworthy. Think of projects under renewed scrutiny today like Tin Tin and the many many works like it. Through repetition and storytelling, deep associations were made and stereotypes created that made members of the in-group more attractive mates than members of the out groups. The same way you thought about Spider-Man through color association but on a larger scale with specific targets in mind.I don’t think this process requires ‘conspiracy’ or intention. People naturally want to tell stories that make them feel good about themselves or their political membership, and this sometimes has the effect of having negative results for other groups by thoughtless repetition of tropes. Sometimes it’s just the fact that the people with access to microphones write from similar perspectives that see the world in similar ways and the result is that the depiction of other groups is not considered critically. So the associations created about those other groups are often secondary considerations to the careful crafting of characters of the in-group. This makes sense to me if I think of humans as a socially advanced primate, whose tools and language allow for much more sophisticated posturing through art and storytelling. I also think that a group who has not had overwhelmingly negative perceptions created by media control might take some of these things for granted, just from lack of experience with the full potential of their effects. To them, it can just be a story.So with this theory in mind. Ask yourself why someone who looks like David Memet is comfortable portraying a black woman who actually really ‘wanted’ demeaning racist sex. The degree of sexual violence visited upon blacks is usually avoided like the plague when conversations around racial power are brought up at all. Especially in relation to its incredibly ugly reality. But this is considered titillating and intriguing to the American audience. The suggestion that she secretly wanted it. Now there are probably women like this that exist. There are many most that will find the subject repulsive and frustrating. What I’m getting at is the question ‘why would a white person be much more comfortable portraying the one in a dramatized story than even talking about the other’? What affect might this have on social perceptions? Storytelling is not as neutral as we would all like to think.",0

"I gather that Susan Sontag thinks that one should not look for meaning in art but just experience it. It seems to me that this has the corollary that if a work does not make me experience anything, I should promptly move on rather than try to wring meaning out of it. Is this implication a feature or a bug?",0
"I feel not enough regarding Madame X was said about the fact he changed the shoulder strap because that was what was considered particularly flirtatious about her, it looked like she had just come from a dalliance, showing the 'fixed' version intended to give her modesty after the scandal has already happened, feels a bit odd. Like showing the Janet Jackson ""wardrobe malfunction"" outfit from before she got justin timberlake to bare her breast, to illustrate the scandal.  It might be still a representation of the event, but it doesn't show the reason. Also she is a finished work, a masterpiece not merely a study, there were studies done in preparation, but she is a study the same way that a memento mori is a study of life and death, I felt the way she's been talked about here feels like she was a study for the artist, and not a work which was intended for presentation in a salon, as she was. I understand that I've never really felt the same way about art, though I have seen it from others, I take from art what I want, and give it back the same. I also find it beautiful and sad that her sister painting was never completed, perhaps because of the reception of the first, perhaps enough has been completed and the fact that her scandalous strap is missing in it's entirety really speaks to the scandal. If the strap isn't even there, then how can be it seen as perverse? The strap doesn't even need to be there on such a strongly boned garment. It can't be pulled down even if you try. The non-scandalous strap is there though, so maybe it's missing because Sargent couldn't bring himself to paint it? Perhaps he loved the delicate draping of the original strap, but if he had fixed the previous strap to try to calm the scandal does he really want to confirm it? The conspicious nature of the missing strap (it's in the tate britain if you want to pop and see it) is full of meaning in it's absence. I have studied art for quite a while, I really wish people didn't feel they have to instantly know how they feel about a piece, since I think often the history behind the art is great for the full experience, like with shakespeare. I know the language can be hard for people to understand, and I really want people to initally grasp the vibes, like the cunt joke with Malvolio in twelfth night is something I feel everyone should be able to get. It's the extra research though for people to get Toby Belch's reference to the Great Bed of Ware or know that a yard is a penis (though the context can help a bit) that I feel are things which I want people to be interested in finding out, also I wish that there was more original pronunciation of shakespeare so those rhymes hit correctly. Like there's no problem with just going ""That's pretty nice"" but like I was talking about with hogs about gorillaz, many people don't like certain gorillaz tracks until they've had time to sit with them for a while. I'm often a bit incoherent with my thoughts but I hope my ideas on this are at least something.",0

I always get so excited to watch your videos, partly because you are such a delight and partly because I struggle with maintaining focus and attention when studying by myself. Having something to look at while I listen, be it a costume change, one of the info tags in the corner, or just having you focus directly to camera, helps me really ""get"" your videos. It truly is incredible work, both as a learning experience and artistic entertainment. You give me so much joy and I hope you are as proud of yourself as I am of you. Congratulations on the play!",0

"You can't really talk about art and meaning without talking about Authorial Intent vs Death of the Author. Authorial Intent is certainly valid and necessary to factor in, but as you said artists change their intent over the course of production all the time and they often convey themes they didn't consciously intend to. Some analysts feel like they have to avoid Authorial intent at least until they've already formed their own reading to avoid biasing their interpretation, the way they see it Authorial Intent is no more valid than any random YouTuber's reading.",0
I think that little metaphors and stuff (like the artistic stuff that makes the meaning) is supposed to be subconscious. It affects how u see the painting but not really like in a major way. And you can ignore it and enjoy the work or notice it and disect what it means (also enjoying the work),0

"I don't think the example at the start, with Dr Strange and The Titanic, shows that it's possible to look at a work of art, think you know what it means, and be wrong. Does anyone actually think that Dr Strange is about people of different social classes fining love on a doomed ocean liner? I think you could still argue that any interpretation a person has of a work of art must have /some/ validity? For it to be their interpretation of that art, it has to be based on that art in some way. Enough for you to say ""oh, why do you think that?"" not ""no that's a different film"". In order for the examples you're giving to work, they have to be obviously wrong, and they're made up with the intent to be obviously wrong. They don't work as counterexamples because if they're not real interpretations they can't illustrate that real interpretations can be wrong. I know that in philosophy it's common to make up extreme examples to test a hypothesis but I don't think that's useful for this question.",0
"Artists are not scientists: they do not have a universally accepted method and – barring rare historical periods in particular regions – _they never have_.  Even though their creation approaches may be grouped into different tendencies, every artist creates for different reasons, so developing a universal method of interpretation is a doomed pursuit. So what do I do? I just dismiss the meaning of art I am without a way to interpret (well, if I don't have any special aesthetic draw, that is)! If I find someone who applies a critical method I hadn't or a life experience I didn't have at the time I viewed the art to draw some conclusions about certain things, then I'll learn from that, and maybe give it a second viewing. Otherwise, I generally apply a literary critical lens, adapted to a given medium I'm engaging with, and if that fails, I move on.",0

"If anyone likes this video and sees this comment, I DEFINITELY recommend you play the video game “The Beginner’s Guide.” Or perhaps “video game” is the wrong term, as it’s more of a guided showcase of various smaller games and interactive landscapes, complete with narration the whole way through. It explores a very specific aspect of “interpreting art,” and I won’t say any more so as not to spoil the twist, but I definitely recommend it. If you can’t play it yourself (though I really think it’s worth the money if you can; even if you never replay it, it’s like paying to see a movie in the theatre) then watch a “no voiceover” let’s-play online, it’s an amazing experience.",0

"When I stand in front of rothko (or however the feck you write his name)  i feel as if im going back from a long and fruitless journey that has taken weeks and brought me nothing but despair. When i have started i chose one direction and tried not to lose my way, even when gigantic chasms opened before me and boiling magma flowed forth, even when wild beasts came from over the hills to slash at me with their claws, tusks and weapons, probably scavenged from those that came here before me. And even when i have seamingly reached my destination, after countles nights without sleep, with not even crumbs left from my rations i thought i have finally reached the fortress of darkness where my reward was waiting for me. But i was wrong, oh so very wrong. For even though i have reached the fortress... There were no blazer spawners. Like WTF?! Not even ONE spawner. I just said fuck it. Build a nether portal and got out of nether. Then i stoped playing minecraft for a month.But like really...

"10:38 I actually had the pleasure of visiting the Picasso museum, and one of my favorite parts was the room dedicated entirely to oversized paintings of pigeons that get progressively worse and funnier looking as you walk through the room.

I also thoroughly enjoyed this one series he did of a dog sleeping next to a piano and the dog gets progressively sillier and anatomically incorrect as he paints. I have a photo of one of his ridiculous looking weiner dogs in my camera roll and it makes me giggle every time I see it.",0
"Idk, in my mind the video opened wrong. Just because some interpretations are wrong doesnt mean there is only ONE right one.

"The description of Pale Fire (haven't read) put me in mind of The Beginner's Guide (haven't played). In both, a character steps into the role of the audience, providing an interpretation that seems at odds with the work being interpreted. But the question rises: if Charles (or Davey) is like an audience making a work that would otherwise be beautiful really all about them - is that not exactly what we'd ourselves be doing, if we declare the purpose of interpretation to be the maximising of artistic value (implicitly, artistic value *to us*)?",0
"I'm sorry, I can't really follow this one all the way. I watched half of it. It's not the video. The video does a great job.It's just I've always found the kind of people who go to a museum and argue over ""interpretation"" and the ""meaning"" of ""works of art"" as being insufferably pretentious. Some artists have stated they have a specific intent others have stated they believe interpretation and meaning is up to the viewer. Some intentionally create works with no meaning at all. For example ""I Am the Walrus"" by the Beatles was intentionally created to have no meaning and to mess with a former English professor of one of the Beatles' members, who was at the time having his students analyzes the Beatles Songs for their meaning. I know this because they said as much.What I'm getting at here is that the whole topic is very droll. I appreciate the effort that was put into it, I just can't watch the whole video.",0

"so we are trying to get what we are trying to get ??     plus isn't it obvious that these modern art pieces are much more about the background than the what on the canvas, like why was rothko particular about the the lighting and and wall paint and the altitude of his paintings, put it next to a dumpster and the experience will definitely not be the same. post mordernist are jus background focused artist. trying to bring attention to the surroundings rather than the canvas",0
"As a fine arts major... I cackled at the zombie formalist's artist statement. This art speak is literally a different language that you learn in the art world. All that statement said was ""I made art violently/physically while I felt existential dread and horror."" He just painted when he was upset lol.You should look at the Rothko Chapel! It's my favorite thing about his work. Even just pictures of it can give you a sense of what it's like. but due to how he painted on raw canvas, they actually had to shut it down while art preservationists try to figure out how to preserve his works while maintaining his intended installation.Also... my opinion is just art should make you feel something. Yeah, an artist can set up intentions and explain them, but sometimes artists make art and don't know why. They just know how to make art. And then they realize what it's about later.",0
"As someone who considers himself to be an artist, I often grapple with this question. The conclusion I've come to is quite dryly this - as long as the commodity form exists, no art can have meaning that is universally ""the right one"" beyond the fact that it is a commodity; a result of my labour to be consumed. The intention is irrelevant. Just my two cents, thanks for reading lmao.",0

Actually doing it damageless is a pain, but very doable.The bosses though. Man. Those are rough. I've done damage less runs for Block Man and Acid Man (in that order). I also cleared Blast Man's Stage (not Blast Man himself, he's insufferable). I'm working on Impact Man. I've cleared every room individually (except for Impact Man himself, also insufferable), but not in one run, which is annoying.I hope GameChamp will make a video on this at some point, but since we still have like... 6 more entries of Rock Man until then, guess I'll keep updating this.

For some reason I wondered why you didn't take the time to render this footage of an 8-bit video game in a resolution higher than 720p,0
"You did it again, Miss Gamechamp. Didn't have to wait that long for another MegaMan no damage run.",0
Let's GOOOO Gamechamp vid!,0
"As I was eating dinner I was thinking ""maybe hitless Rockman 4 is out yet?"". Pleasantly surprised. You absolute madlass.",0
the things that interest and amuse you are kinda sad...,0
"where is ""how many shots does it take to beat splatoon 3""? you did splatoon 1 shotless and the minimalist runs for splatoon 2 + the octo expansion so where is the splatoon 3 video[lol i said ""splatoon"" 4 times (5 if you count that last one)]",0
Alright where's wily (says for the fight time),0
will you do a tier list for damageless megaman?,0
"This begs the question: Which is next? Rockman 5 hitless or Splatoon 3 shotless?Either way, I'm hyped",0
now do 5.,0
"The fact the spambot replies to every comment in order makes it mighty easy to mass report, that's good service!",0
you should try to complete splatoon 3with no shooting,0
There's so much strategy on a game that plays with only 4 buttons and dpad,0
oh god there's a spam bot. Gamechamp!! Call the exterminator!!,0
"Man, this guy is really good.",0
9:21 this could be the perfect line for some villian,0
This is one of the most impressive and awesome video game achievements I've ever seen. Nothing beats the amazement on my face seeing gamechamp somehow manage to beat Rockman 4 without taking a single hit. It must have taken years to come up with these clever strategies. Now do Rockman 5,0
Why do we need the Dive Man E Tank?,0
"Can you beat the Half-Life 1 Pacifist run?Rules:-Not allowed to harm anything-Enemy is allowed to harm itself (i.e. Houndeye destroys an Explosive crate with its attack)-Mandatory boss fights (Gonarch, Blast Pit Tentacles, etc.) are allowed to be attacked-If an enemy is killed by you in some way, you are allowed to load a previous saveOptional routes:-If playing on the Black Mesa remake, try also going for the Rarest Specimen or Pizza Precipitation achievement",0
And this was the worst of the 11 games.,0
I have a questionOn a scale of 1 to 10 how much easier was this that rockman 3,0
"Dear Ms. 3000: You claim to not be good at videogames, yet your name is ""Gamechamp"", which implies being good at video games. Why do you say this? Are you secretly good at video games, ms. 3000?",0

SHES DONE IT AGAIN,0
9:37 doesn't E tanks heal? This is a no damage run right?,0
"Maybe it's because I owned this one, but I feel like the robot patterns are MUCH easier to master than Megaman 3. Plus of course, it doesn't have those damn middle levels.",0
wow this game looks way better designed than mm3,0

"You should make one for Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero. I actually would be intrigued on if you can beat the game without getting hit, killing a single enemy or maybe even a run consisting of how many hits total can you avoid inflicting while besting the game.

You need to do a challenge for splatoon 3,0
Now do minus infinity mr perfect,0
She who ?,0

Do Rockman X  •_____•Edit: Rewatching 1 2 3 and This Im Glad Theres a lack of Suspicous Moaning after beating a boss saves me alot of Awkward Conversations,0
"I don’t know if you can, but I can &gt;:]",0
WOW ALLREADY ITS HEREEEEEEE,0
So splatoon 3 is out... try to do that challenge where you see how much times you shoot,0
9:21 abortion,0
"as someone whos playd this game 10000000 times (not exaggeration probably) its very funny to see any of the minibosses described as dangerous. ive fought them all so much that i do them damageless anyway, the rhythm is in my soul",0
Splatoon 3 Shotless/Minimum Shots when?,0
Still bad at videogames,0
You got hit multiple times in this video so you did lose the challenge,0
no,0
"Okay cool, but. Now it’s time for splat 3 shotless",0
can someone PLEASE go check on her. i need to know shes ok. this much no-hit rockman cannot be healthy,0
That’s crazy but when does rock man 5 come out,0
"OMG! I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR MM4!!! 😊 I also noticed your pronouns on the streaming screen, after you beat Dive Man, I think I've used male pronouns for you before and I apologize for that. 100% unintentionalI LOVE you channel, and can't wait for more ☺️🤘",0

I can't wait for her to do Rockman 5! It is my favorite. No pressure though.,0
I like that this is probably the first mr perfect run that you can do in order,0
well now you have to do rockman 5!,0
Can you complete splatoon 3 hero mode without shooting all weapons but with specials,0
Can you? Yes. With a TAS,0
You sure don't sound like a she,1
I wonder if the 5th game will take 5 yearsI also think we can all agree that toad man is the best boss in all of video game history,0
If you use the charge shot only its easier to time drill man.,0
Great video also when will you do a splatoon 3 without main weapons video,0
Was a while ago I last watched your videos and this happened to be in my recommendeds! So glad to see you’re still around beating video games! I’ll definitely make sure to watch some of your newer uploads!,0
"I dunno if you still take suggestions in comments, but here goes:Can you beat Mega Man Legends without collecting treasure?",0
This is great!! I have to go watch the others now that I know about them!,0
"weird how I first thought you weren't gonna do mega man 3, then 4. but at this rate your probably gonna do them all by the time mega man 12 comes out lol",0
Perfect-san 4 (100),0
Next up rockman 5 and no need for special weapon all you need charge buster shot only because is busted,0
Now Mega Man X without getting hit. &gt;=),0
Good luck beating splatoon with bombs only (definitely not possible),0
May I suggest rockman 6 without taking damage/j,0
"""We'll acquire Item Number B"" threw me. I've been awake for 24 hours. I need to sleep.",0
Imagine if this goes on through all 11 rockman games and then MegaMan X,0
Happy birthday Charles!!,0
This one seemed to be a little easier than Rockman 4,0
Why collect E-tank?,0
You’ve done it yet once again,0
Wanna hear my guess for the next run? Splatoon 3 Minimum Shot Run…in it’s entirety.,0

That E tank was crucial to the run,0
I never knew you were trans! Not that it's relevant in any way to my enjoyment of your content. Just interesting to know about you!,0
what does a girl have to do to see No More Heroes beaten on bitter without taking a hit,0
why do you put yourself through this torture?,0
You should do splatoon 3 with minimum shots,0
"i do not know who this is, but when reading the names at the end, YOU MISSED CHARLES SURETTwhoever that is42:55",0
Do you think the Megaman 8 hitless challenge will be harder than the ball only challenge?,0
"Its crazy how this was probably harder and has a longer video and took less time than 3, gamechamp is becoming more powerful and we have to make sure she doesnt reach mm8",0
"Wtf, Skull Barrier has a USE on the final boss?You're an awesome player! Trans rights ^^",0
maybe for the trash robot they just put a random robot hit box and when you shot that missile it legally kills the bot and thus the hit box is gone?,0
"I’m curious, why are you doing the jp version instead of the English?",0
This just proves that rockman 3 is a bit more difficult than its sequel,0
is she gonna go back to 3d platformers? i love gamechamp but all the megamans look the same to someone who didnt play them &lt;.&lt;,0

"Happy birthday a couple days late, Charles. Also I wanna know if you subscribe to Gamechamp's patreon if you can get her to say something really heinous and taboo, like ""I like pineapple on pizza sometimes"" or something similarly forbidden.",0

"At this point, the boss music doesn’t play for the Robot Masters, it plays for her now.",0
Something about this and the No-damage run of MM3 feels off when compared to the first two.,0
So when's Minus Infinity?,0
"Mega Man 4 is my favorite game in the NES hexalogy. The charge buster is pretty fun (even if it edges a little close to being the go-to weapon over Robot Master weapons at times), Cossack and Kalinka are great characters who don't show up often enough, the visuals are very nice, the music is great, it has some of my favorite Robot Masters, and it's the first time we see Wily use an innocent person for his own gain (besides Light himself), which shows how far Wily will go to further his own plans. I'm glad to see you finally put it back on the shelf!(Is it notable that there are skull-based enemies before Wily's reveal, including a whole Robot Master themed around them, implying that Wily's skull aesthetic is so strong to him that he can't even abandon it while trying to go unnoticed? Could be! I think it's a fun flaw to apply to Wily)",0
Love how she talks like anyone else is gonna do this.,0
What happened to no hitting Rockman 3 being enough?,0
HOLY CRAP SHE DID IT!Now do 5,0
I saw this and felt badThe poor lass is onto 5 now I bet,0
i have no tips he is unbeatable,0
The skill. The mastery over the game. Now do Rockman 5.,0

Oh duck 😳 I need see All the playlist of Megaman Damageless again,0
"incredible video, i learned a lot while watching and i'll definitely use some of these tricks for fun even if i'm not planning to no hit this game any time soon! I love videos that dive into games like this and have a lot of specific game knowledge that one can apply in their own runs (:",0

"Random thing, i really have liked your splatoon videos and was wondering if you are going to do a gunless splatoon 3",0
"You make these look so easy, I decided to play them myself.. how hard could it be?Couldn't even get past the first level 😂These games are way harder than they look!",0
"the wily capsule reminded me of the wily capsule from Rockman 7. to my memory, it’s almost impossible to dodge his attacks. doing this sets you up for pure suffering along the road",0
"I think this wily may just be Willy's brother wahwee. Remember, Wily is actually from an alien race.",0
Well that was fast. Congratulations girl,0
I just realized the name at 42:38 is supposed to be the Welsh town. You know the one.,0
Mega man 5 theme starts'I'm sorry ok,0
31:06 c’mon now dawg,0
rockman 5 next,0
SHE’S BACK!,0
Now do it with Rockman 4 Minus Infinity.,0
I've been thinking if actually recording a mega man X hitless video is a good idea,0
"""They don't address this in game, but if you check the wiki: Kalinka asked her Dad pretty please for the Necronomicon.""That is a sentence I heard while I was alive",0
"this one came out suspiciously fast compared to the other one, I hope your not being good at a video game.",0

God help this girl,0
"I CALLED IT, I CALLED IT!",0
SHES BACK BABY,0
That's it you're going to Guam,0
why do you do this to yourself?,0
"I'm not sure why you directed viewers to farm Eddie/Fliptop for an E-tank.  Obviously, no health recovery was needed if you pull off the damage-less run.  I thought perhaps there was some sort of AI alteration that occurred from having one in your inventory, but there was never a mention of it after pick-up.",0
Does anyone know that this person’s pronouns are? I heard that they’re she/they but I could be thinking about someone else. I used to watch this channel a ton but I haven’t lately.,0

"45:02 Huh, it looks like ""I'm going to unban Julius Xeno"" finally managed to unban Julius Xeno. Good for them.",0
"I like how you can tell how much more polished this game is in general compared to 3, so much less hearing about hits being basically random chance, and more skill and proper weapon usage.",0
completely pointless but here's a glitch for Rockman 4. If you finish off the cockroaches while flash stopper is in play the game will softlock with the spikes being the only way out,0
Mega Man 4-6 are much better designed than 1-3 so its obvious that they can be beaten without taking damage without any major mental gymnastic or outlandish effort.,0
"No way!You actually did it, Such hard work!................Now do Rockman 5",0
Hey game champ! Splatoon 3 is out and I'm wondering if u can beat the whole campain with either a bomb or little buddy please,0
"As someone who did MM4 run recently, with as little special weapon uses as possiblei can say one thing:I HATE SQUARE MACHINE I HATE SQUARE MACHINE I HATE SQUARE MACHINE I HATE SQUARE MACHINE I HATE SQUARE MACHINE",0

6:12 Sprite Man,0

"Oh just great, I go on vacation 2 days per year and that's the day the MM4 no hit run gets uploaded",0
"Remember when she said “DO NOT ASK ME ABOUT THE FOURTH GAME”?Welp, the fourth game has been blessed upon us",0
Ah yes my favorite number W,0
Can't wait for the future when Gamechamp reveals she actually knows how to pronounce Llanfair­pwllgwyngyll­gogery­chwyrn­drobwll­llan­tysilio­gogo­goch,0
Wow Gamechamp is very smart and skilled and funny,0
"at about 3:33 the visuals of the video froze but it wasn't yet buffering (common lag thing for me, network card was fried and there's an unreliable wifi adapter) so i thought the pause trick was back",0
LETS GOOOOOO,0
Please make a run: can you beat splatoon 3 without firing the hero gear,0
41:51 The spirit of the Binding of Isaac narrator took over champ for this one,0
SHE DID IT. Gamechamp is on her way to being the Master of Mega™,0

Somehow you always upload when I’m away from home in extended amounts of time. You’re basically my comfort channel.,0

"Happy birthday, Charles.",0
"If you did or didn't know this ""tip"" already, Rockmans 5 and 6 are pretty much just more of 4, but with changes to Rush and the items.",0
"Let's suffer toggether, GameChamp. I always attempt to do these as I see you upload them.I shamelessly use your suffering to decrease my own. I'm not sorry, I'm thankful.",0
"yesssssss new gamechamp, today is a good day",0
at this point she may as well do one of these for a bullet hell like touhou or dodonpachi or something.her tenacity is frightening...,0
Man I’m just drunk and seeing this uploaded just made my night,0

6:21 yep,0
"It would be about the ""puzzle platform aesthetic"" if the puzzle wasnt immediately solved. Everybody knows what they need to do its just hard to vidualize or internalize the timing. A lot of times in mario maker levels its a near frame perfect jump or a visual cue using a coin tail to aid in the process of the high skill required to complete the level. (Most kaizo levels have stuff like that) i just cant easily visuallize any cues in this. If its really about the puzzle and not just a trollish tree jump into a 1 block space then it feels like there should be some kind of visual cue",0
I am 10 and I like your videos,0

What about straight people? Don't they get to use their freedom of speech too? If a person turns around and says that their country has no use for homosexuality then you need to suck it up or stop listening if it butt hurts your well being because it's his right to say whatever he wants also. As long as people ain't using gay slurs or passing nasty derogatory remarks or calling people names because they are gay then people should just put up or shut up. He ain't causing undue pain and suffering to anyone just by saying that his country had no interest in such things he's just voicing his opinion and he's not bashing anyone and he's not slurring anyone. People should learn that it's not just their world and people can say whatever the F they want just as long as they ain't proper taking the piss or taking any liberties while doing so.",1

Couldn't agree more. In Canada a few years ago a transexual woman who still had a penis went to several salons asking for bikini waxes but was denied as the married women didn't want to fiddle with another man's penis.

They have real problems to deal with, not the feelings of the lgbt and whether they can parade their degeneracy in the streets.  They are Christians and hold those principles important, not perversions creeping around to pollute the minds of the young. I do admit jail time is harsh - def not the death penalty is ok, but keeping a stance to ensure that as long as 2 people are consenting adults to keep it behind closed doors is not too much to ask.  Russia's stance is just that - Dont bring it to the streets!",1

"This interviewer doesn't realize that not everyone has the luxury of addressing issues like LGBT rights. If your country or society consider their biggest problem is the lack of LGBT rights, you are privileged beyond your understanding.

It really gives you perspective to realize that the kinds of social issues that we tie ourselves in knots over day by day are just not on the radar of other countries who spend their energies focused on problems like widespread poverty, lack of education, fighting disease, and so forth. There is a prevailing feeling among many in the West that many issues like LGBT rights and feminism are the great battles upon which the fate of all human civilization rests. In contrast, listening to this Kenyan president provides a window through which we can realize that regardless of your views on various modern social debates, it is mark of how blessed and well-off we are in the West that these are the kinds of things that we can afford to focus on.",1
Why doesn't the American Media ever go to other countries and interview the leaders there about how America treats black people?? Why don't they ever ask them what do they feel about the American government allowing the daily murder of black people in the streets?? Since they're so concerned about human rights. Why don't they ever go to these foreign countries and ask the leaders why America comes in and steals their natural resources and leaves many nations poor??,0

"She basically pushed him into a corner of you're a homophob and his like where we come from that isn't up for discussion.  Historically sexual intercourse between men involved the act of placing your penis in the Anus. Which definatly without the medicines and understanding of hygiene of today, would've caused infections and illnesses. Religious and ancient laws are made as guidelines for everyday life. Hence the washing of hands and hygienic courtesies of Muslim and Jewish traditions. Holy water to wash hands and hallal/kosha meat to drain the blood to prevent the meat from rotting so quickly in the heat.  Understanding is the first step to resolution not blaming and instigating conflict on opinions and beliefs.",1

Just to put some facts straight, NO Kenyan has ever been jailed because of their sexual preference despite having that as a law, we live in harmony and we are respectful of other peoples beliefs. This really is a non issue in Kenya otherwise other Afrikans wouldn't come to Kenya to find safety because they're being persecuted in their own countries because of their sexual/gender beliefs, the law is there but it's not enforced, people are free to themselves in Kenya and their rights are protected by the constitution.",1

i completely understand freedom of speech but judging from the comments its very clear we forget about freedom in general. freedom to marry and love who you want. its not a hard concept to grasp. there's absolutely no reason why people should be praising a man for saying he doesnt care about equality lmao... thats not something you praise get your morals straightened out... but i also get what hes saying personally i disagree a little since some people are ofc afraid to speak out about what they want (so many examples of this i shouldnt have to give examples).,0

In their own time they will. They have more dire problems such as hunger, water shortage, poverty,  etc. So that is their call when they make a ruling on the subject, not ours to make or judge upon. Us Americans can't even make strong laws for gun control which is responsible for thousands of lives in a year at least. Who are we to tell anyone else how to live and what laws to follow?",0

"Regardless of where you come from, the LGBTQ + do not represent the mass of the population. At one point many were sympathizing with the volume of physical abuse these groups were having, and indeed these things were address and they were given eventually equal rights to live in society and to practice their lifestyle in certain countries, but they were not satisfied, they wanted to force their ways into every avenues of life. The were forcing themselves into private businesses and purposely targeting specific business with the hopes that those businesses would so call discriminate, and they were successful to a certain degree with some. They were targeting churches especially Christian churches in the hopes of forcing believers to accept their lifestyle in the churches and with the even greater hope of getting bibles removed and rewritten to suite their agenda. They are trying to force societies to accept their lifestyle as normal. That is why they were pushing the educational systems to give lessons to children about the lifestyle as being normal, shoving the idea in the minds of children, confusing the children with lies with no real science to back it up. They are successful with countries where they have either many members infiltrated in high positions or have sympathizers doing the work for them. If put the vote, real votes like it was done in the time of the cowboys and Indians, you would see how many reject this nonsense. I hope Kenya will continue to push and reject and not allow their little parades to be given rights that many of us would not even be able to do even with are normal ideas.",1

Because if thats the case then yes that is a problem. There is something called minding your own business and someone likeing another person of the same sex has nothing to do with you. Someone please reply because I feel like I'm missing something. If he is talking about marriage or people calling themselves some random gender then thats a different story, but if you support attacking someone whatever it is physically or legally for doing something that doesn't affect you one bit then yes that is an issue.

"For anyone who disagrees with this man, I personally don’t think he’s saying that equality for the LGBTQ+ community isn’t an important issue overall. His focus is on Kenya, he was on CNN as a representative of Kenya and it is his job to represent his people. His stance is that in Kenya equality for the LGBTQ+ community isn’t nearly as big as a problem as it is in the western world mainly because of the Kenyan culture. If you don’t agree with the stance of the people he’s representing don’t go to the country. Just a different pov 🤷🏾‍♀️",0
"While He represents the will of his people, i don't think That is whats Happening in the first World. Everyone I talk to are so done with lgbtq Agenda pushed down our throats but somehow its what everyone is legit scared to voice. How can That be? The politicians love These topics bc noone loses when we push lgbtq stuff but if actual change is asked for the poor and under priviledged the politicians just try to beat around the Bush bc the rich pay them to not make any change That could hurt them... It's a mad world",1

And damn, what a good leader “My decisions are based on the wants of my citizens, and the entire country literally said they don’t want homosexuality, regardless of my personal beliefs”.

Mind your own business lady.",1

I'm not trying to force my way of life on anyone and just trying to survive like anyone else. I'm not saying I'm making it a choice to be Bi just to be seen as disgusting, but I'd rather be seen as disgusting and keep doing what I've been doing.

"Homosexuality is a western invention.They , the west, is trying to prove that people are born gay, that its a matter of genetics. In islam there is no such thing as sexual categorisation. Any man could desire another man, it could happen to me to you , even to the prophets. Once the sahabas(companions of the prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him) asked the prophet if they could have sex with men war prisoner and the prophet forbid it. Were the sahaba gay? No, they were just far from their wives and they thought that they could commit sodomy with other man in halal way yet the prophet stopped them. If Allah didnt created women, probably Homosexuality could be halal. But Allah in his wisdom made Eve as wife of adam so that adam could have halal sex . If Allah would have not created women, then all men would have sex with each other. The strong would prey upon the weak . The world would be a big prison and we all know what happen when we incarcerate men together. Do they suddenly turn gay? People should ask themselves these question. But only the one who reason would understand.And one of His signs is that He created for you spouses from among yourselves so that you may find comfort in them. And He has placed between you compassion and mercy. Surely in this are signs for people who reflect. Surah rum aya 21",1

As a Muslim we don't condone this. Especially these disgusting people. All our top scholars don't agree with them and we're glad they're gone. And btw I don't see many people quoting the Qur'an for killing being a sin. So here you go: “Whoever kills a soul unless for a soul or for corruption [done] in the land - it is as if he had slain mankind entirely. And whoever saves one - it is as if he had saved mankind entirely.” (5:32 ) “There shall be no compulsion in [acceptance of] the religion. The right course has become clear from the wrong.” (2:256)  There is  NO  religion for terrorism,0

One question why do u guys hate gay people? Cause I'm confused what they do?,0
"There not scared because it is there law, just like we have the death penalty, just because it's hidden, they do it in front of everyone but it is their law and it's no different than killing someone in any country. What because we don't see it makes it better, if being gay is a crime, they know the price is death. That's what real Muslims believe and even God before Jesus came to free us from the law said the price is death because it's sin. U should thank Jesus, he took ur place and nobody is killed for being gay because it's a sin God has to punish because it's a choice. We make the wrong choice, don't we die by the law of the land. Without laws u have no order. To them its normal but America thinks u can change the laws they make, to them its not cruel, they are only doing what Muslims were told to do and u can't change what he said even tho I believe he was a fake teacher, they don't and it's their law so get over it. U can't change it and they still kill u today 4 it",1

"I wish I was straight. It would be so much easier. I mean, I do like men, but I also like women, as well as all other identities. I just like people ( around my age, obviously ).  My dream is to marry the person I love, and either adopt or have biological children. But I am so terrified that my loved one and / or my children could be harmed because of the life we've lived.  If I end up marrying a man, that's great! I can pretend to be someone I'm not, ensuring the safety of my family. But I'd just be lying to myself. If my husband wasn't already informed of the situation, how would I tell him?  Would it change the fact that I loved him / our children? No! I would still cherish them with all of my heart. But I am a very honest person, and keeping that part of myself hidden out of fear would make me feel like a liar. Like I was a fake.  I'm so terrified. And my parents! My dad's adoptive family is open to it, but we're not sure about his birth family, and my mom's family is an absolute no. Around my dad's birth family, we just don't mention it. But around my mom's family, there's always a heavy pressure that we absolutely cannot bring it up.  I don't want to be shot in the streets because I wore a pronoun pin. I don't want my partner to get hurt because we went on a date. I'm not even in my twenties yet. I don't want to die!  That's why we push so hard to be seen. Unfortunately, a part of our community has taken that message as an excuse to be awful. They scream and terrorize and justify it with ""representation"" and ""rights."" But that's not what the majority of us want. We just want to exist without fearing for our lives. Some people take our name and use it to identify as an object or an animal, and it's disgusting. Neopronouns are a f*cking joke ( the xir / ze ones are debatable at best, but I think only people in the community should use them, and outside people can just use they / them as umbrella pronouns ).  Please, just let me exist. I don't want to bother you, I just want to live. Please don't kill me.",1

So disgusting &amp; ironic that this ""activist"" chooses to go after specifically trans poc.  I'm convinced that Google is run by leftist pedos atp. I've been noticed this shit. Been seriously questioning their morals &amp; integrity for a while now.. this 100% confirms it. Throw a lot of social media right in there with it. Hate that people are really ok with this, just shows the absolute degeneration of society. Just horrifying, all of it.",1
Blaire you are an amazing lady! I have just recently been introduced to you on YouTube. Keep on keeping on! I know so cheesy but that’s how I feel. 🥰,0
Pretty much all of this was taken out of context. It's incredible how conservatives LOVE to take information and hyperbole it to fit their agenda to gain views. That's  all you're really interested in Blair.,0
Is no one gonna mention taking the blue pill,0
"As a male born male, when I was a bit younger, just the MENTION of potentially taking prescribed testosterone to help deepen my voice was completely shutdown without question…",0
And now he’s on Dr Phil smh 🤦‍♀️,0
"Blair, I been a long time follower of yours and have admired you for years. Without you I would have not accepted trans people and saw their issues as real. Unfortunately you have turned into your rival Reilly where you don't give the full facts and have turned a blind eye on what doesn’t support your agenda. What makes it worse is that you will tear other people down in your own community to build up thise who want to harm your community like Matt Walsh. For this I will have to unsubsribe to your channels. I wish it didn't come to this but I'm on a different path now and have let you go.",0
For those who want a different angle on this story watch Jessie Gender's video.  https://youtu.be/cya2IyZmZOQ,0
Wow this person still on the internet and not banned? Disgusting😅,0
"I like Blaire and that there's at least some resistance to this stuff. But in it's deepest core she will eventually defend gender confusion because ""she"" is a biological man. You can't f.ex sit and drink on air and promote sobriety.  I kind of get for some reason what a nightmare it would be for Blaire to detransition, but at some point we all have to look in the mirror and accept what it really is.  Self delusion is natural because it's difficult to face who we truly are.  At some point reality is gonna catch up with us all whatever it is. You can't run from it because it's the shadow of yourself that turns as the light is directed at you.",1
"This is random, but Libs means “liberals” right ?",0
Damn those fingers are manly.,0
"Blaire, you over-pumped the lips.",0
"Seems like as soon as a man claims that he's trans, or just not a male in general, they all of a sudden get a pass for multiple offenses. If Ezra Miller's getting away with the BS he's been doing (I use proper English, he's not a group of people), then why is anyone surprised by the offenses that this dude (IDC what gender he thinks he is) has been committing. Keep holding them accountable.",1
"you go girl, we need more people with the courage to stand and say what is the right thing and time..need to ask what are they getting out of it???  You're awesome...keep it going...",0
Carabello where did I hear that before...,0
"Blaire, please do a video on Keffels. That guy is an absolute lunatic that gets children to take DIY hormones.",1
"Eli Erlick has connections with Katie Couric, photos are on FB..  His family have connections so he is going to get away with his crimes. Democrats.",0
Eli Erlick is a straight guy who has hurt women. HE is a predator.,0
Eli Chapo Guzman is in the house now lol but fr this is seriously disturbing,0
I’m sorry Blaire but I disagree completely.,0
I didn't even know who she was until one of my favorite content creators made a hate video about her. I sat there waiting for a reason to actually hate her....one never manifested so I subbed. They need to put their bs aside and save the kids.,0
"Well done, Blaire.",0
"People have been misgendering Erlick's victims, and it needs to stop. Danie Yun was not a woman. Danie Yun was a trans person who specifically used they/them pronouns, and had undergone top surgery for the purposes of gender affirmation. It is very important that people stop erasing the struggles of trans men and transmasc people who are raped by trans women, and whose accusations are silenced on the basis that men (and masculine people) cannot be raped by women. Erlick accused Danie Yun of ""transmisogyny"" for holding her accountable. It is a tactic of silencing victims that I have seen employed by trans women in the past. Stop misgendering Danie Yun in order to push the idea that Erlick exclusively targets women. Danie Yun's identity matters too. The experiences of transmasc and trans male victims matter too.",0
What in the what?  Why is this creature getting praise?,0
BLAIRE WHITE ARE YOU HIRING BY ANY CHANCE,0
"The trans culture seems like a dichotomy, on the one hand they want acceptance from everyone but with the same breathe they will silence any trans that don’t follow their narrative!!!! I’m soooo confused!!!!!",1
here on the recent comments to see the chasers thirsting over you,0
"The fact that Eli Erlick live in New York, and with all the rising crimes there and there is no accountability from the feckless District Attorney, don't hold your breath. Eli getting justice won't happen anytime soon. Sorry to have to say that.",0
"I wish conservatives would also push for a stop for male genital mutilation in the US (Circumcism). Kind of shows their bias when they ignore the big one, yet want to the more minor issue. Focus on both, otherwise you're a hypocrit.",0
"Receiving somebody else’s medication‘s is a federal offense. Prescribing or giving somebody else medication that is prescribed to another is a federal offense. They are not physicians and they are not qualified to do so. How is this not a punishable offense? My kids school can’t even give them a Tylenol without calling me but it’s OK to give children these medication‘s? Wow. This person should never ever be able to see the light of day again. Not only with the drug trafficking, but all of the other monstrous things that she has done. Unbelievable",0
Tip submitted,0
This Eli guy reminds me of Keffals.,0
"That is all so f-ed up. The drugs, that's insanely dangerous. And love how she's been called the new face of feminism. Sure. Awesome. Nothing says 'I'm a feminist' like being accused of r*pe.",0
I think the DEA has bigger problems to deal with than this,0
"I would have DIED to get hormones for free like this as a teen… which is the problem. Being an adult now, nothing changed and I’m still trans, but if I’d done something like this and it turned out I was mistaken it could’ve ruined my life.",1
"This has never been about the LGB, it is about the 'T'.  LGBs do not need hormones or surgeries nor do they promote it. And why do these freaks think these hormones should be handed out? It is b/c  medical practitioners are handing them out when they should not be doing it either.",1
"As a gay man this is extremely disturbing and very disgusting. All these pronouns and thousands of things you can label yourself to identify with- like wth! I remember when things were just so much more simpler. You were either Straight, Bi or Gay. What the h*ll do I look identifying as a Zir????! This sh*t is  starting to sound like Plant of Aliens. These people are not part of the LGBT community. I do not condone that behavior.",1
yoooo im trying to build muscle. could really do with that free testosterone.  might pretend im a trans man,0
You belong to the FREAK SHOW!,0
"Blaire, why not involve medical experts in this, getting their opinions on free distribution of prescription drugs, and also get pharmacology experts to get involved. They would represent ""the science"", right ?",0
"Alejandra is also evil, no humanity in her. I'm convinced she could run a gulag or death camp and sleep like a baby. Just that sort of person.",0
Thank you for speaking out about this Blaire. I love that you give no shits.,0
I don't for a second believe that Eli thinks he's some kind of victim.  In fact I think it'd the opposite. He only posted that message about how it's hard being a trans person for victim points.  The reality is that  he and others like him live a life of privelage where the FBI and police ignore their criminal activity.  Simply because they identify as a protected class.  For the love of God he's commitng a federal offense!  This all goes to show that if anything many minorities now experience privelage in our society.,1
"Eli needs to be in prison. Full stop. I've reported them hundreds of times on social media. Instead of of standing against drug trafficking to minors, they remove any negative comments towards eli. We should be just as irate at social media platforms for protecting a rapist, drug trafficker, and groomer.",0
"Fellow leftist here! I completely agree with what you said about the word trans cushioning the blow. It's like just because the person is trans, it takes all accountability away. It's terrible. Equal punishment for the same crimes, regardless of gender. That's gender equality!!",1
oh ffs. Lock him/her/whatever up,1
"And this Ladies and Gentlemen is what happens when true, responsible, accountable, qualified ""parenting"" is absent. Cell phones are raising our children, replacing a human's needs, purposes, missions, visions, inspirations, mental balance, and God. Bring back the Draft, bring back the Pledge of Allegiance, bring back real men and real females, bring back the era of Ladies and Gentlemen, and bring back discipline or what is left of the human species, now more digressed than ever, is doomed and evolution ceases at all levels.",1

"I’m a socialist, always have been a socialist, I agree with her on this. We should not be pushing children to take puberty blockers. It’s nothing against trans people, I just think kids should wait till they transition.",1

something worse than jessica yaniv....? Oh...it's bad.... I have to mentally prepare myself for that.,0
Look at his eyes. No matter who or how you identify the eyes absolutely the window to the soul.,0
😱😱😱😱😱😡🤬🤮What kind of person can be ok with distributing hormones like that was no big deal and then even to minors!?!,1
i really like your video you're a very good youtuber,0
This swine is being protected. It's actually one small part of a scheme to leave the LGBT hung out to dry. Out of left field will come a right wing resurgence (I have a faceboot for the mechanisms of division and the main culprit is the false left right paridgm). Sometime in 2023 the clown in the white home will be removed in a planned nationalist takeover. It will be harsh for any democrats. There will be a constitutional ferver complete with left wing witch hunts. America will become isolationist and enjoy a period of extreme prosperity but society will become even more sick and hateful to one another. As far as the left has been able to go so will the right and then some. It will be a Christian fundamentalist even puritanical administration that will go too far and further divide and destabilize the nation just as it has been planned to. Be who you want but don't identify in any of gov's ticking traps. Be good to others and yourselves and never follow leaders. Peace,0
"Eli is a gross person, and definitely the 2nd worst person you have covered. Jessica Yaniv is a whole nother level of... this",0
"I don’t affiliate with a political party. Usually I look both ways before finding out what I think is the truth in a story. I can surely say that with even those screenshots alone, there is enough damning evidence to put her ass in the can for life and that I don’t need to look at it both ways. Eli’s a monster, or perhaps worse.",0

Blaire you’re a man in makeup with silicone bags shoved under your chest. I love your videos but you need to acknowledge reality for what it is too. You’re not above the truth just bc you criticize gender ideology that you also embody…..,1
Was that a real knife?,0
Not gaol. Prison.,0
"Ha, this POS tyrant blocked me about a month ago.  Hahahaha, Blaire, I love you. Not like, “What’s up, girl?”   Like, “Goddamn your smooth.”",0
I only want to know the lipstick and gloss you used for your lips 🥹 Girl they looks so plump and pretty!,0
Its amazing how Pedophilia and Child Abuse is becoming as normal as the Average American citzen using their Smartphone on a dailybasis. (maybe not that far). But just the stuff I hear from Matt Walsh &amp; Michael Knowles on a daily basis and Horror stories like this or similar on an alternative channel of mine make my blood boil.,0

To the people who believe that allowing a stranger off the Internet to give your child drugs is a good idea ask yourself if you would be okay with a stranger giving your kid meth. In order to be OK with one you have to be OK with the other. So either you’re a hypocrite or you don’t actually believe this is okay.,0
So many of the trans women are trending. I transitioned before trans YouTubers . I’ve been on hrt 15 years.,1
anyone else considering a free test cycle to boost their gains? No questions asked? I'm surprised gym rats aren't beating down her door for that sort of thing.,0
Yeah! Drug up the children! Yay! 🤮 STOP HER!!! SEND THAT POS TO F’KIN’ JAIL!!!,0
"Hello Blaire, I've been watching you for awhile now, and you are my biggest inspiration. You deserve to be the amazing person you are, I hope to be maybe be an inspiration like you are to help people in this scattered yet chaotic community. I got a long way to go as I'm in the beginning of it. Anyway keep these videos up, you are helping keep kids safe. You are helping people view us in a new light. Let that shit shine.  Much love.",0
"Bad people should be punished, no matter how they identify.",0
My question is....if you can't answer what a woman is...then how the fuck do you know you aren't one??  And how come it's always women and never men?  This whole fucking thing is utterly bizarre. Blaire makes sense. So many others just do not. Ugh.,1
"Hello Blaire, I have been watching your channel for a long time. I could genuinely say you are one of the few(if not the only) ones that sustain their opinions through logic and overwhelming intelligence which seem to be lacking in today’s society. I bumped into this news today, I was wondering if you could make a video on your opinion on this topic https://youtu.be/pJiArhPrvks",0

U so cringi,0
"It's crazy how I never heard of biological lesbian women or biological gay men sexualize so far!  it's always almost most that are either Bisexual/Pansexual/Trans/Non-binary and etc that use ridiculous pronouns. So proud to know most of the lesbian community are against this big time, survivor of R*pe/m*lestation speaking against. (Just know that not ALL of the community is like this so don't go after all trans/bisexuals and etc.)",1

I hate Blair white.,0
I like how we believe texts and DM's with no actual evidence...Americans..smh.,0
America has always been weird with drugs. Being in Canada watching your channels you could be enjoying a family sitcom and when the commercials come on it’s just drugs and supplements.   Regardless of what you think in terms of people from other countries minding their own business these things have no borders. Apparently in America it’s very common for people to be prescribed medication for their mental illnesses but they can skip out on the therapy part of it… in other parts of the world medication and therapy go hand and hand… so when you hear people talking like Trisha Paytas about what they have and what they’re on but they’re not in therapy it’s a little sus…  Also imagine being prescribed medication for a mental Illness. That’s usually something that’s fundamental to a lot of people’s well-being. I wouldn’t be comfortable whatever the case with sourcing medication online through social media…,0
Im not a conservative and i follow your content.,0

"You know what just occurred to me: If they ""brutalize"" him in the men's prison, it will be considered a crime. But if they ""brutalize"" him in the women's prison, it will be justifiable self defense.   As much as Eli deserves what's coming to him in a men's prison, I hope he goes to women's prison. Go ahead, ladies. He's a pervert, it's a free one. Do what you want with em.",0
"Let's put this in perspective: I have ADHD. If I tried to offer my meds to kids who need them, but don't have access, I 'd have the DEA breaking down my door within, like, 24 hours.

Hi,0
"This isn't even safe for adults. I'm an actual woman with slightly elevated blood pressure and my doc didn't think it was safe for me to take estrogen to control my fibroid symptoms. This isn't even taking into account people with autoimmune disorders.   Blaire, you're a man. Eli is a man. But if y'all are adults who want to alter your bodies to appear female and you accept the risks and also that women might not accept you that's one thing. But that's not what's happening now. People are being told that they can change sex with no consequences.   No one can change sex. And there will be profound consequences.",1
"Look, adults can do what they want. I don’t have to agree. It’s a free country. But why are lgbt targeting our kids???",1

"Wait, they’re “trying to get the police involved”? Why is she not in jail? This is child abuse, breaking felony drug trafficking laws, grievous bodily harm, serious assault (maybe culpable homicide-not sure of US laws) and exploitation of minors (at the very least). Alone with a lot more. The person needs to be doing hard time.",0
The more I learn about Eli the clearer it’s becoming that he/she/piece of shit.  Whatever it identifies as is a groomer and goes after vulnerable people. This person is targeting the trans community how is this person not in prison or at least charged with something? Just because this person is a trans person who regurgitates all of the nonsense the left pushes they are still supported by the media and will probably get away with this because of it. If Blaire did something like that she would already be charged with something and they would be celebrating her downfall. I’m just sayin.,1
Thank you for your work. Your open mind and your voice. Children don’t know there favorite color let alone if they want to chop up there bodies. Don’t stop  fighting.,0
What does cis mean . I'm new to this whole thing . I'm just worried for the children .,0
It's not a right or left thing this goes beyond that. He needs to be held accountable now,0
Why can't some one show that one post about him sending kids these drugs to the law and start an investigation on the abuser,0
CDC has said these drugs can be harmful to some kids. .Eli has done some bad stuff I've heard . Why is he not in jail.,0
That is real dangerous eli can get arrested,0
"Hi everyone, I am asking here because that seems to be Blair's most recent video clip. I am in a professional situation where the transitioning of a 12-year-old is celebrated. People are unaware of any possible harm that could cause. I am into that issue and know better but I do not know of any good source that summarizes the problems. Do you have links to ask beginners to read through? Thank you.",0

Eli deserves to be rot in prison for 100 years! dont even put her in a male or female prison. she deserves to be in solitude for the rest of her life. she is a danger to the lgbtq community and vulnerable young women!!! absolutely disgusting. so utterly disgusting. that poor girl who killed herself i actually started tearing up",0

Clothing change, and hair can be changed without serious forever damage... Meds, hormones, surgery can not. Just my opinion. This person is horrible for trying to even do this!

i feel like theres more pressing issues to worry about like oh i dont know.......the economy......war....healthcare....just to name a few,0
"here is my largest issue with this (other than the S.A.) and this may sound cold, but its to highlight the issues.  as a ""Cis"" (hurrah for made up terms/derogatory slangs huh?)  my Testosterone levels it must be below 300 by a ""significant"" amount, note 300 is bare minimum for health as a male. typically insurances wont cover it until 240-250. so AS A MALE BORN AND RAISED, I cant get Gender affirming or mental/emotional medications. and I cant get the pills it would have to be a visit every few months for a shot.  if I were a TRANS male, then they wouldn't let it slip below 400-500 (depending on state and insurance company). they could get a shot AND pills.  thats not where it stops tho...   as a ""Cis"" if I were to pay out of pocket, then I can get it prescribed as low as 450-500, and it would cost me hundreds to have it done. and option for pills would open up, however they are not ""cheap"" either.  as a TRANS, if they pay out of pocket. the target range goes up to 500-600, and it would be 25-33% of the cost that I would be paying.  and now there is an open market if not free market as long as they are trans? its pretty bad when lot T men may have to start identifying as Trans men in order to get the medical help they need.",1

These poor people who did not deserve it were all human beings and children of god regardless of race gender I’m sick of hearing people say gay or transgender people are going to hell that really isn’t true the truth is we’re all sinners and admitting it means u accept it and that is what god really wants for u to be truthful if u admit that it means that you are a follower of god that is how it works repentance is just that gay and transgender people are not going to hell is not true,1
I’ll pray for gods justice,0
Everything u say is right but don’t u worry Eli will be severely punished if not in this life in the next life in hell as u said I myself an a major activist I’m a mother of three this enraged me,0
This is rampant in NGO's period it's. Time to drop the  partisanship. You can continue to protect anti life in the fictitious which comes at a cost of things mentioned in this video. Hopefully you'll choose team life instead. I have half in mind to go pull up individual people's ngos especially when they just got interviewed on super popular YouTubers channels. Instead I'll just say this in 1970s the prime Minister was in on it and he would literally bring the kids on his yacht. By the 1990s and 2000s there was all these drunken songs about acting a fool and I'm on a boat b****. #Magenta it's not only unnatural but it's the new color of slavery. Wear  Earth tones trie to negate them you know like the color of moss dandelions etc,0
I find it weird you deleted one of my comments a while ago about a fetish that was even highlighted on soft white underbelly. Where you take local anesthetics in a cold medical table put the person halfway under insert catheters and then hopefully pretend doctor diddles them or leaves them there to have some sort of cathartic experience allegedly. If that's not a worship of death right up there with the insinuations of child abuse and Moloch's worship I don't know what is. It also wouldn't be available to your average Street junkie like myself just so you don't think I'm special or any kind of moral haranger. The closest you could get to that being broke is maybe you could swipe a fistful of vials when your dentist leaves the room at the community health center good luck mixing them and injecting them smh. I'm getting to the point grooming and nudging is serious and it's been around since at least 1850 and innumerable contexts cross borders in a multiple nations. The worship of death is real. I no longer think it's a coincidence. Nor do I think it's my active imagination or severe paranoia I'll have to I'll happily take those claims levied against me. The alleged fact checkers usually working for places like the Washington Post but more surprisingly even pro publica. Are paid six figures to bury this stuff and more importantly the same faces that keep popping up almost in a networked relationship,0
Would like to say all of their funders whether it's that dude in his pornstar girlfriend whether it's bodybuilders in Thailand and their designer drugs or this weirdo who fits perfectly in the vein of every gender dysphoria behaviorist claiming to be a psychologist doctor whatever.

"Blaire, I'm new to your channel, a straight cis woman and still very much confused about the many issues surrounding trans issues or what, in terms of the world today, trans even means. However, your videos do not make me feel ignorant or stupid. In fact, the opposite. I love to learn and like to think i have a very open mind,  especially about things I don't really understand.  I'd like to express my gratitude  for your incredible insight, wonderful open-mindedness and balance regarding the current issues surrounding the trans community and society in general. Knowledge is something I value and it would be be so easy to fall into the extreme opinions of either side. Your videos are so refreshing and thought-provoking in all the right ways. I admire your approach to having conversations like these. You are intelligent, objective and courageous, At risk of being attacked by saying this, I was 2 videos in to your channel before even realising you were trans. Aesthetically speaking you are probably one of the most beautiful women in the world I have ever seen. I even saved a video of the work you've had done to take to my cosmetologist, not only because I love the perfection of the work  you've had done, but because you explained it so beautifully and above all, honestly. I'm so happy I found you. You are truly an educator,  above all. A beautiful one at that, inside and out. Much love from Australia xxx",0

"I don’t think hormone blockers and cross -sex hormones should be completely banned for minors. I think if it is very well regulated and taken seriously there can be some instances where it is okay.

"Why is it always immediately to ""affirming"" care? Why is it never.....affirming if the person may actually be helped by transition? Why don't we affirm the reason WHY they may feel this way and ask that in therapy? Why do they need to avoid the period of TESTING as fast as possible? They themselves admit that it is a mental distress. They don't really have a choice in their admittance of this when they bring up Suicide as an argument for why you ""should just let them do it.""  And they even have claimed and harassed detransitioners with the very contradictory statement of ""you were never trans."" even though the radicals are the ones that believe in Genderfluidity lol so by their own logic Genderfluid doesn't have real dysphoria either since one day they have dysphoria about being a man but the next they feel like neither, when in ALL confirmed cases of actual gender dysphoria it is ALWAYS from male to female or vice versa. But never ""male to neither"".   How do you feel dysphoria over wanting what doesn't actually objectively exist? Being genderfluid/nonbinary has zero expectation of appearance or even a requirement to change your appearance or name. They don't make any sense.",1
I wish it were true that most others cared about children as much as you do. They don't. The whole scheme is targeted at making the abuse normal.,0

"The trans topic really makes my head spin. It turns everything we know upside down and complicates things. Here’s an example of what I’m talking about:  Does Eli go to a men’s prison or women’s prison? If Eli goes to a men’s prison, there’s going to be hardcore abuse toward her (which people will argue she deserves but it’s not just right). If Eli goes to a women’s prison, based on the history, there’s the possibility of abuse and rape toward the female inmates.  And if Eli does go to a men’s prison and gets abused it will be blasted all over the Left wing media, and if Eli goes to a women’s prison and abuses the female inmates it will not be covered at all. People are terrified of being labeled “transphobic.”  I propose a separate area for trans women only and a separate area for trans men only.  Anyways, I was thinking about this.",1

"This isn't ""left"" or ""right"" to me. I'm not sure I still have faith in the usefulness of those descriptions overall, but I digress. Most everyone would categorize me as 'radical left' but I watch and enjoy all Blaire White's current work. We need to listen to anyone and everyone who is willing to acknowledge the full complexities of the modern 'gender wars'. Blaire is one of the few people who can express empathy and criticism for both sides in the same moment. That's not easy. Most people who start that way will cave to one mob or another, always apologizing and wavering in their values based on audience response. The intellectual and emotional honesty shown in modern BW content is miles beyond anything you're gonna find on ""BreadTube"" or other 'acceptable' leftist spaces, tbfh.",0

"The most important ‘affirmative’ medical care for young people that do not identify with the gender that they were assigned at birth is psychological help. There needs to be a distinction between neurodivergent and neuro typical young people that do not identify with the gender they were assigned at birth. Because they have different needs. Genuine trans gender people want to be normal, so they want to blend in to society, they want to get married, most importantly THEY WANT TO HAVE CHILDREN. That is not to say neurodivergent people do not want children. But, let’s be honest, neurodivergent people live in an alternate universe where their lives revolve around fantasy such as Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, World of Warcraft, cosplay, comic conventions, robots, alien life force, anime etc. That is why 76+ genders were invented, they were invented by neurodivergent people. Their lives are fabricated behind a computer and the internet. Neurodivergent people have every right to be themselves but they need to be accepted not surgically and  hormonally interfered with. They are often ‘transitioning’ to fit in with society, not because they feel like the opposite gender. Whoever is exploiting this should be absolutely ashamed of themselves.",1

Amazing how they want to act like these drugs don’t have serious and horrible side effects. London shut down one of there biggest trans clinics cause of the harm to minors. One 15 year old kid has the bones of a 70 year old person cause of puberty blockers and not having there bone density tested. That child is in a lot of pain now and there is nothing that can be done. We can’t reverse it so he will have problems for the rest of his life and can never live a normal life again. It’s sickening adults are trying to get kids to take drugs with horrible side effects.,1

"All this flippancy about regulations is scary &amp; infuriating. It reminds me of my own nearly-fatal, medication-related incident. When I was younger, I was on The Pill. My doctor knew, because she was the one that prescribed it. My mother knew, because I had told her about the symptoms I was having that led me to consider it. But even still, 8 months later, I ended up in the ER unable to breathe because the meds had caused blood clots to form in my legs that then traveled to my lungs. I could have died. So many women die every year from that exact complication. If I had been taking meds given to me by some random person, if I had been keeping it quiet from my parents, I absolutely would have died that night. But my mom knew, was able to speak for me when I couldn't, and the ER team was able to take that knowledge and act quickly &amp; concisely. People that want to give out pills to kids (be it birth control, hormones, the abortion pill, whatever), in secret and without any regulation or oversight, want those children dead. Plain and simple. They want them dead.",0
Part of the reason why this person is getting away with doing what there doing without getting more public outcry then what there getting is the fact that they are transgender and that there portraying themselves as being some sort of Robinhood like figure who is working in opposition to the law for the good of a group of people who are deemed as being oppressed and marginalized granted I understand that trans people/trans youth are not really being treated the best by various people but doing the type of thing that this person is doing particularly in the long run is most likely about to do a whole hell of a lot more harm then what it does good.,0

Hi my name is George from Miami I always like to know knowledge and stuff so I love your programs you're very very respectful so I respect you anyway I was kind of curious well he's going to get busted you know for what he's doing and those people are working for free oh my goodness I wonder how much she's collected yeah like to ask you a question I don't know if you'll give me the right answer or not know it's long and all these therapists and all these doctors and all this stuff and going through surgery like crazy here there an area oh my God I feel for you anyway I wonder how much does it cost you and I just out of curiosity cuz I know these guys were making money off you but just out of curiosity and that's the first the second I remember in my time everybody in school went through depression everybody was talking about killing themselves and the only reason we didn't is because we have somebody behind us kicking her ass forward so every time we heard somebody say oh I wish I was dead it boom you get kicked in the ass you keep on going until you finish elementary junior high and then high school and then you start on college but you know nobody's kicking nobody's butt to go forward and all that kicking kind of helped you kind of forget about killing yourself and going through depression everybody had it and I'm 68 years old so all right well thank you this is a real good program I enjoy it and yeah I'm straight but I enjoy it because I like to know a lot I know a lot but I don't know nothing and it's long as I have that idea that I don't know nothing I like to find out research it and stuff so thank you for your program all right thank you very much,0

"Eli is from a town next to mine. Since our towns are small, and very rural there were very little resources for LGBTQ youth. My town is the seat of the county so most of the available resources were here, and I volunteered for them. When I met Eli, he was quite dismissive and seemed to care more about the visibility than the actual work. At events are conferences everyone from community heads to speakers would pitch in and help set up but Eli only ever showed up to speak. I got the distinct impression that everyone thought Eli was this golden poster child and shining example and deserved a pedestal.  I maybe that's why nothing has been done. I am shocked and saddened to hear how he turned out.",0
Wow those Eli sympathizers prove just how f’d up our world has become,0

The pride/LTG community are in urgent need of investigation no one but no one with a sexual identity crisis should be even allowed contact with children. We are heading for a generation of non-functioning adults who will need constant mental health support for the rest of their lives once this fashion trend has been put to rest in the dustbin. And this is a fashion trend no more no less. How to be trendy by getting your rocks off with the children of the people you despise.,1

I was with my partner through their transition and all I can say is hopefully parents notice the changes in their kids if they are using um... services like these. And hopefully they don't write it off as puberty or something 😕As an ex-junkie this infuriates me on a personal level. If someone with a prescription for Dilaudid was sending their meds to someone, even an adult who really needed them, the FBI (or whoever) would be rolling over them before the package even left the post office.

Wouldn't that harm tell you he's disingenuous about his identity, and using the LGBT community as a shield for protection?

Testosterone is strong enough to cause strokes and many other things, if you are trans and are looking to start hormone replacement therapy please please I ADVISE you go to a licensed doctor DO NOT go to anyone unlicensed offering hormones.

When i was in the 4th grade in the 70's my single mom was so awsome she was the most darling waitress in a s. cal harbor steakhouse.  She let us stay at home alone all night.  she had super cute clothes and jewelry which I would just glam out with.  Then she got drugged at a bar and wound up marrying the guy.  and I was taken out of the slum and lived in your world where I was hauled off hundreds of miles and abanbon.  how much would you pay for this story?  I was totally able to fall in love at first sight in kindergarten.,0

Once these people who are truly suffering make the change it's no longer possible for them to reproduce. Destruction of family, marriage, and the lowest rates of child births in human history are also signs. How about global pandemics? Margret Sanger wanted to sterilize Black Americans, but settled on creating Planned Parenthood and aborting them. With blaming human populations for climate change, or natural resources being unsustainable. This justifies their horrific beliefs which allows them to remove who they decide. God isn't in any of their minds nor beliefs. Killing is a sin, as well as harming a child. Jesus said anyone harming a child will wish they had never been born. Prisoners treat those who harm children rather quite harshly often even death. The left thinks we are deaf, dumb, and blind which might lead to serious crimes in the not so far reality. If they allow this then they need to remove drinking age laws, and legalize all drugs.",0

Why is this tiny minority the ONLY ones who matter? Right, cause that's what serves your agenda, not objectivity.

Maybe make it balanced and talk to some happy trans people as well. You know, the majority.",0

These people that are doing this know the statistics, they know that most of these kids grow out of this. They want to create a mass amount of people that are mentally ill, that are suicidal, that hate themselves. It's not just the money from the transitioning, it's the money from the therapy, and the years of counseling that many of these people will need if they don't commit suicide. These people are sick and they need to be stopped. They need to be in prison.",1
"Uh, if you do not see the connection to over medicalization and pharmaceuticalization in general that has been happening for decades, you might think that trans programming is an isolated phenomenon. NO, it's so much bigger. Did you sleep walk through cofed mass formation psychosis psyops that debilitated people mentally and physically and killed them?! Same mass formation psychosis techniques being employed. Climate change, same mass formation psychosis techniques being employed. Big money cancer industry - same mass formation psychosis techniques being employed. THINK. Do you really think this is the first instance. You don't have to be a historian, you just have to know our socioeconomic, political and cultural history to understand what's happened and what has happened in the past. This type of atrocity is being normalized and legalized. So called historians may call it good in the books. We were smart and knowledgeable enough to stop Hitler but Hitler was just a puppet for multinational corporate monopolist globalists. FDR and Churchill made an unholy alliance with Stalin and Patton was against that alliance. We did not need Stalin according to Patton. Coincidentally, Patton was killed after the war. No longer necessary and he had too much integrity and spoke his mind. Do a case study and historical study on multinational corporate conglomerate, Siemens - you know, the ones who manufacture industrial wind turbines. Do historical research on Bayer. The globalists are winning right now and they have their puppets in place like Biden and Trudeau. Prince Charles and Klaus Schwab head up WEF. This goes real deep. Charles is the descendant of King George and it's payback time. We, the peasants are nothing but experimental lab rats, useful idiot tools, serfs, slaves and easily expendable fodder to eliminate.",0
Well done putting it out there. Kids need saving,0
The fact is if you take a thousand of these kids and even a fraction of them are going to find out later on that they did the wrong thing and regret it and commit suicide or be suicidal then it's the wrong thing to do. And the numbers are way higher than that! We don't send people to the slaughterhouse and expect them not to be slaughtered. This is being done on purpose. We need to end all transitioning and hormone therapy for children under the age of 18. All of it.,1

I’ll bet all I own that detransitioner stories would never be made available by groomers to kids,1

That hurt.,0
"How it happened is very simple - it's a mass mania that is the culmination of decades of leftist cultural disruption. When they ask how did people let it happen, the answer, also simple, is that, 1st, the left always pushes their agenda harder than others, so the culture is disrupted, little by little, more and more and, like the slowly boiling frog, no one realizes the great danger approaching until the mania has already begun.  2nd, after the fact, short of jailing or killing people, there's no way to stop a mass mania other than to wait until it dissipates. It dissipates through resistance to it, but it can't stopped short without physical restraint, i.e., imprisoning or killing perpetrators. There's obviously no stomach for or thought of that at this point.",0

People have been jailed for giving someone drugs that made that person doing crazy stuff because they were seen as helping or whatever. And affirming or pushing for a transition especially for anyone in lower age should be a crime too. For mental health they say medication isn't the solution but a crutch or help and working on yourself is the real solution. Then how come drugs and surgery is THE solution all of a sudden....crazy!,0

"Why not have the Surgeons, Drs and everyone invovled sign something  that they will be held 100% responsible , good or bad? And if they balk, then you have your answer, that they don’t even stand behind their beliefs . Now my thoughts on that shop teacher in Canada,t he one with the huge prosthetic  breasts, if she is now a woman ,would she not have to reapply ,for the job? Shes a new teacher ? Im serious here,their all going for throats Ellen Page is dead Elliott page  is now ,,if their previous identity is dead, their not the same person then how is it that they are still benefitting  from the dead person the were before ? Don’t call me Ellen Page but yet has no problems using that to keep careers ? Reap the money and accolades .acting roles ? Same with the shop teacher ,if he is dead , or no longer how is it she can slide in and take over ? Should she not have to apply , go back to school get all the degrees ?",1

"Money has become literal #1 over all... including furthering the species as a whole. Birth rates aren't exactly high.... The more ppl who transition means less population made the ""old fashioned way""..alot of us natural born women are going through menopause in 30's...so time frame for childbearing is early years (20's) for alot of us... Basically they are openly sterilizing ppl and making them believe it's a good thing. Women being refused hormones FOR menopause issues (which last sometimes up to 10+ years!) But they want these kids to mutilate themselves... 🤦I trust no one anymore wtff. Back in the day they pushed for FAMILY. FAMILY LIFE, ""American dream"" :own a home, have a family of your own and maintain them. Idk wtf it is now",0
The doctors know NOTHING about hormone therapy. It’s still brand new. I’ve been doing steroids for a decade. Doctors know half of what I know. They don’t manage estrogen levels for these kids when they’re adding testosterone. It’s just laziness and financial motive on the professional end.,0
"Couple of things; while I acknowledge that there are mature teens, neither of these ""victims"" communicate like seventeen year old girls. Further, if they are seventeen, who's to say they're not typical attention-seeking kids? That they are exaggerating their circumstances.

Yes, the ones pushing and promoting are absolutely the worst kind of human beings.",1

"I know I'm a man. I know what a woman is. I think women brains and men brains are not the same. I suppose it is possible for a person to sincerely and actually be ""stuck in the wrong body"".   Even still, I am strongly opposed to all these procedures for fear of even ONE case suffering from dysphoria or mental disorder of some kind and, like these victims, would have grown out of it with talk therapy or just time. I can not imagine anything more horrifying than going through a medical procedure meant to ""fix"" you at the age of 14 only to discover it resulted in genital mutilation you have to live with your whole life. I guess I am opposed kind of like why I'm against capital punishment; for fear of one innocent person being killed. 14 years old? Approved elective genital surgery? Hell, 8 years earlier, that kid ""identified"" as a firetruck or a princess. This is insane.",1

I think they expect straight people to be into them, which will only happen, sorry to say, if the straight person is majorly disturbed.  I feel bad for these kids.",1

Nothing tragic here..Only bad ppl making bad choices..Accept who you are..They want to detrans so they will cry after to be trans again.. They are insane..Assume your choice and stop playing the victims.. Anyone logic wont do things like that..So now go cry to your cult,1
I hate how anyone has to go through this. Especially if they never would have had gender dysphoria before. But the depression in this video is also what many trans teens feel.,0

"in that first story, its almost as if the mental illness was the culprit all along and the transitioning did absolutely nothing.  what a crazy concept!!!  we're feeding delusions of mentally ill people and wondering why they're still damaged after they go through with their impulses in an attempt to feel 'normal.'  the one constant is that the girl is still left obsessing over details about herself which is likely the OCD and Bipolar Disorder working away on her own mind to pick herself apart with bouts of depressions when shes feeling low from bipolar episodes.  its sad and its crazy that shes still a kid at 17 years old but feels like she already ruined her life from choices shes made 3 or 4 years earlier",0
Theese doctors are the same type of people as Mengele or Shiro Ishii. They will be judged the same in future generations.,0

This is dreadful indeed, but the numbers and barbarity of legal abortion are on another scale altogether, dwarfing anything the Nazis ever did.  How about a video or ten about women who dare admit they regret having had an abortion? In Gwendolyn Brooks's words: 'Abortions will not let you forget. You remember the children you got that you did not get....'",0

This is terrible. I feel sorry for these people. They’ve been brainwashed and left with irreversible undesirable consequences. The ideologs who encouraged this are nowhere to be found. There’s no real help for these transitioners. The network is trying to block these individuals from telling their stories. How evasive.,0

The world doesn't need to worry about covid, or CRT, or climate change either, the world needs to worry about Armageddon. Get right with God now, Jesus is coming soon.",0
Transition surgery is a violation of the hippocratic oath,1
"This is so heartbreakingly tragic. It’s not her fault it’s the adults around her, her parents, doctors.

I pray for this child and all the others like her. 💕",0
"Get professional mental health treatment. If that fails. If you want to murk yourself, write a note to your mother explaining your actions, that you chose narcissism over being yourself, then do it.

I don't even know what to say... these poor kids.,0
"I remember a story I heard a long time ago, more than a decade I would say.  It was about a man whom was abducted by aliens and he said he managed to communicate with them.  He said he asked them; ""What are you?"" and they supposedly replied along the lines of them being humans from the distant future and were unable to reproduce.  This was the reason for the reported abductions in our time, and why abductees often reported having something harvested or stolen from them.  Their reproductive cells such as eggs and the little swimmers. I thought little of it at the time, it was just a story and it was an interesting perspective, albeit slightly familiar from some sci-fi schow I've seen at some point in life.   But this is no longer a fiction in my mind, I truly believe this to be a possibility now. Going down this road, along with the other things causing issues in reproducing; this story is a completely plausible idea in less than a few hundred years. Radiation and electromagnetism, bad food and GMO food with the epicyte gene which attacks reproductive cells (put into corn, why?), the promotion of transgenderism and all the other agendas going on right now which actively affects human reproduction, is far from a conspiracy theory at this point.  It's the agenda - Population control. Say it Matt, don't be afraid to speak real truth, to real power. Instead of just making fun of mentally ill teenagers, that's easy prey.  Go for the big whales here, expose the real agenda and not just the surface stuff.",1
Young detransitioner' should be a blasted paradox. Sad.,0

"Parents are supposed to protect their children from doing stupid shit like ""transitioning"" or thinking they can actually become the other gender. Has anyone considered the real possibility that if they were born the other gender they would still be dissatisfied with their current gender and would be prompted to transition? Just because you're a girl and not a boy doesn't mean you need to transition and just because you're a boy and not a girl doesn't mean you need to transition. I feel like no matter what you were born as you would want to be the other. Have you considered this? Just be who you are.",1

I know that seems like common sense, but all it takes is one severely traumatic episode to possibly make a kid suicidal for the rest of their lives, unless they are able to get serious professional help.

"Why aren't kids taught how to actually love themselves and their bodies? There is no baby that is born thinking 'this body is wrong.' These 'clinics' shouldn't groom kids but actually help them explore why the body they were born with is awesome. Instead doctors are allowing kids to change their bodies like swiping on Tinder.

Instead of accepting the truth from real doctors and therapists, many of the individuals who prusued this lifestyle choice of theirs based on narcissism sought out ""doctors"" who would tell them what they wanted to hear.

Pray for the young women highlighted here. God is the Redeemer. Pray He brings something good out of all this for these poor little girls who were abused in this way. They need some hope and purpose. This is heartbreaking! The lawsuits need to hit hard and fast until doctors fear the repercussions of this abuse more than they fear the mob and name-calling. And then states need to make the medical transition of minors illegal.  Texas has the right idea.,1
"People in the future will laugh at how in our times the only options given to people with gender dysphoria were bodily mutilation and taking hormones.

It’d be awesome if there was an advocacy group/organization that supported detransitioners, provided them with resources, and gave them a place to share their stories.

"Hey, you can do an opinion poll from all over the world. People think this is strange and pretty wacky. In the 2000s, we thought gender change surgeries were just an extreme form of plastic surgery. This stuff wasn't supposed to go mainstream. You guys really need to talk sense into the people around you before they become a statistic of the blunders of history, because this can't/won't continue. It is unsustainable for society.  Thank you for all your work Matt!",1
It would be a good idea to make a support group. A lot of these kids feel alone for making a regrettable decision. Having a group could mean sharing the pain together and learning how to heal from it together.,0

These parents and healthcare professionals who are pushing this and allowing a child to make permanent decisions that will change them forever!! 😢 This is sickening and will be traumatic for these kids. The kids that are young just don’t know it yet. Parents are supposed to protect and MDs are supposed to do no harm. This ain’t nothing but a big ol science experiment and parents are just signing kids up to be slaughtered. These poor kids!!!! Feelings change and especially as we experience life!! How do these people not understand that!!!,0

"Being an adolescent is a very tough time for a lot of people.  Transitioning from a kid to an adult and finding your place in the adult world seems simple and easy for some. But for the rest it only makes their confusion and anxiety all the more severe when they compare themselves to the others who don't seem to have any problems at all.        And there's an entire community of people telling kids, ""all your problems will melt away if you reject your very biology"".  And it's a very attractive proposition, because as soon as a kid announces they're something other than they were born, they're now part of a group that tells them how ""amazing"" and ""brave"" they are.        Misery loves company.",1

Things fell apart a couple of times and had to be repaired, and now (s)he is 100 pounds overweight and practically catatonic with chronic fatigue and depression from issues that never got resolved by the surgery.

"I'm a detransitioner and a conservative but I'm getting really tired of Matt and the entirety of Con Inc's de/trans grift. When Matt especially feigns empathy after so much open mockery, which he slyly does so often, it's extremely grating to me. A large part of trans activism, ie especially ""trans actors for trans roles"" and the like is the rather understandable sentiment ""keep my name out of your mouth when I'm not around"", which watching Matt talk (on and on) about people like me I start to understand once again. I appreciate your levelheaded masculinity Matt, but that also contributes to the fatal lack of curiosity for and resulting understanding of the mindset of these vulnerable youths you claim to care about. I know you think you're trying to make a difference in The Marketplace of Ideas and ""boost our voices"" but I find these readings of intensely personal r/detrans posts for sycophantic clicks rather vulgar. Again, I am on the right as well, but We are not a part of your partisan war games. You remind me of the liberals who pryingly embarrassed me with overpraise (""you're so brave"" and the like) with this detrans bandwagoning. I admit I don't really know what I'd rather have you do instead, as the discourse jockey you are, but I feel very invaded with every story I see from ANY ideological angle about this and I'm not alone.",0
Demonic,0
This is exactly why I say no one under 18 should even consider hormones let alone surgery. Most grow out of it by 21. This is just fucked up.,1

I cried for this poor child. This is wrong if a kid cannot consent to tattoo a child cannot consent to not being real therapy and have people manipulate them into being trans and also allowing them to consent to these permanent changes. Two things can be true it can be a positive things for adults to feel safe expressing themselves but this is disturbed and disgusting to push this on children you can have some thing that is overall good and it can be co-opted to do other bad things if this group can’t stand criticism they don’t deserve to have the standing that they do. They don’t seem compassionate at all unless it serves their narrative and the women who get impregnated in prisons the poor children who are not able to make decisions like this do not have an understanding of gender and to be forced to live as a boy or a girl based on simply being a feminine or masculine child is disgusting people are taking away expression.,1
I've been watching this channel for several years and there have been some sickening topics but I think this portion of this episode has been the most harrowing I have ever seen. I even went to the r/detrans subreddit and it's all the same. I feel as though I can confidently say that transgenderism is the most evil ideology in human history.,1

"Poor kids, their parents should burn for this, their kids want to kill themselves.

I'm so so lucky I had a good mother to guide me through that.,0
Going to be A LOT of these moving forward.,0
"This is the saddest thing I've heard in a long time. The only way we will be able to put an end to this thing is if the people who were so severely abused and ruined by these people start suing them until there is nothing left of this horrific business. It doesn't even have to be the majority. If enough people sue these monsters into the ground, nobody will dare do this to any more people for fear of being sued for everything they have.  It's just so sad, because it preys on girls when they are at their most emotionally vulnerable. I don't blame these girls for not wanting to be a girl. I wouldn't want to be a girl while going through puberty either, it sounds AWFUL. But this is worse than awful, it's hell. That, and I'm convinced that it's a social contagion. Many of these people only want to transition because they see people doing it on TikTok, and girls are very susceptible to emotions that make them want to feel like they are part of a social group. They are more sensitive to negative emotions than men, and they will do anything to gain a feeling of one-ness with others. They are not in a position to make a rational decision, they are too emotionally volatile and confused at this stage of their life. When their hormones stop raging and their emotions calm down a bit as they reach adulthood, they realize how bad of an idea it is.  I want to know how we got to this stage. Why the hell does anyone think it's a good idea to so recklessly tamper with human biology at the most important developmental stage of their life? Hormones are powerful. These people have played God and thought they could shape a human being however they saw fit and not see any consequences. Well, here are the consequences. I can only hope that by the time I have kids, this practice is destroyed. And I pray for those who are victims of this. They have been thrust into a hell that is going to be very hard to escape. We need as many people as possible working to mitigate the damage as soon as possible. They need to form support groups, and they need to be given a place where they can heal their minds and souls as much as possible. I'm afraid it's mostly too late for their bodies, I imagine, but if they realize their mistake soon enough, maybe it wouldn't be impossible to help them.",1
The Devil’s agenda is what the left is all about.,0
i can't believe none of these poor kids have shot up those experts at those clinics....wouldn't blame them,0

Hard to blame the parents when in some cases they dont have a say.  Systems are in place to hide things from them or even  rip the descision out of the parents hands.,0
If we don't do something to stop this now in 20 years all these young adults are going to be walking around depressed confused lost because they can't be who they want to be because they've been butchered or chemically changed,0

How did these demons get unleashed on us. It seems as though we finally went over the cliff.,0
Excellent! I didn't know you're doing detransition stories. You should compile them in a easy access section on DW app if you and your team haven't already. That way it's easy to throw the stories in peoples faces when they say no one is detransitioning. You do great work man.,0
But all these doctors have an agenda to make money they don't care and they're all on the left these obviously aren't ethical doctors conservative doctors cuz it would have never happened,0
Because the therapist was a liberal with non-conservative views when you pick a therapist you make sure you know who they are next time,0
Well we know this is gonna happen it's common sense,0
"Those poor girls.. I didn’t even know you could transition at 14, how disgusting",1
"This is exactly what I was talking about, these poor children are being mentally abused and not thoroughly vetted for treatments! I was 35 and had lived a full life of memories before committing to my transition, these poor kids aren't given a choice! It's purely disgusting and I commend you Matt for standing up for the kids, this crusade of yours is an honorable one and you have gained an ally! God Bless you!🙏😌",0

"I think this is a very good time to reflect on how we should treat people that continue to identity as trans.  Yes, if they’re a full on advocate shoving it down everyone’s throat, there’s a lot that they deserve coming to them. But many transsexuals are just normal people who are struggling greatly with their identity and mental health, and have been indoctrinated into thinking that they can transition and it eoll fix their problems.  When the day comes that we can have conversations saying that we want to help these people, but dont think that ‘transitioning’ is the right answer, we will make significant progress as a nation and as humans.",1

"Somebody please help us conservative therapists who are hogtied in our profession to even help these kids question their transness. There’s so much legislation and pressure from our liberal professional leadership and the liberal states that we live in to affirm these children that I’ve had to take off of my website that I help with questioning sexuality because I am not trying to get arrested for not affirming their transness. I was trained to not affirm someone’s mental illness but to help them get to the bottom of it and learn to live in the body that they have. Other therapists will just not come forward because we are terrified that we will lose our license, that we will be arrested, that we’ll be sued,  and we know that if we are shut down, what hope at all do these kids have for any kind of professional to use known mental health practices to help them. I really want to help children and adults who want to Detransition but we need lawmakers and lawyers and celebrity figures to get behind us because we can’t do this on our own. We will be crushed. We have seen others get crushed and we are terrified that will happen to us. Not all of us can just rush out and throw our career aside to take this Juggernaut on. We have families we have to support we have other community members that require our help. We need someone like Matt Walsh to step forward and help us. Maybe Jordan Peterson could help us. Somebody please this is our cry for help as true therapists.   I pray every single day that God will show me someway or that will inspire others to help us. I feel like I’m just kind of hiding out until that happens so that I can leap forward with my arms open professionally and say that I am able to help detransitioners. If I can’t help my own niece who transitioned into a man maybe I could help others.",1

It’s not perfect, but there’s still a lot you can do.  Some people get into car crashes and have burns and all types of horrible things happen to them. But, there’s still a life worth living even after the devastation.  Your life is meaningful and God loves you.",0

I think that taxpayers should have to foot the entire medical bill for 'gender affirming transition surgery'.

You might need them later.,1

I was actually banned from the Askreddit subreddit recently. The reason? There was a thread asking what practice will be looked back on in a hundred years the way we look back on lobotomies today. I said the removal of tits/dicks from healthy children and BOOM! Instantly banned forever...🤦‍♂ I hope the people currently behind this movement feel REALLY bad in a few years time. Sadly I think they're too stupid to feel that way...,1

Even if we do accept transgenderism as a real thing children should not be able to make that decision.,1
I will never understand why people like Matt think that just because a small amount of people detransition that must mean all trans people are invalid and faking or lying or whatever bullshit. The percentage of people who do detransition is so small and even within that small percentage the more common reasons of detransitioning are things like cost or lack of support from family. The amount of people who detransition due to regret or not being trans is very small. You shouldn't take that small group and use it to judge and hate actual trans people.,0

You get no more chances to grow after your body is “completed.” Females (all mammals, reptiles, etc) are not biologically intended to have male levels of testosterone, neither are males (mammals, reptiles, etc) biologically intended to have female levels of testosterone.  Don’t do it. You’ll regret it.",1
"I'm not a detransitioner, thank God, but people tried to groom me into it when I was going through my darkest times. I suffer from a condition called puberphonia, so my voice didn't develop. This was enough for people to want to make me believe I was a transwoman. Thank God, I already had my mind made about my identity, and I already understood and followed my faith (as a Christian), or else, I could have been influenced by them.  The first girl's case is bad, and I can say this from experience. When I open my mouth, it makes me cringe when I hear my voice. I tried speech therapy, but it was not successful, so I think my only choice is surgery in the future. She still can get a female voice by submitting herself to the thyroplasty type IV surgery, but IT WON'T BE THE SAME AS WHAT SHE HAD. Even though the surgery can help with the voice, it will never be the same due to the influence of testosterone during her puberty, and I'm sad for her since I can still bet on the surgery to help me get my natural voice, but she can't. Her voice will never return to what it was in the past.",1
I think a lot of these girls would benefit from a breast reduction. A lot of times girls who developed way too early with very large chests are very self conscious. So from a DDD to B could make them happy not these horrific mutilations.,0

"It breaks my heart hearing about these individuals realizing that they made a mistake transitioning and the severe depression it has been causing them to the point where they think ending their life is an option. This is exactly why gender affirming clinics should be illegal because they are not looking out for the best interests of those questioning themselves and seeking help. Discovering and questioning your own identity is a natural part of life. If people are pushing you to surgery as a way to discover your true identity, then they don't have your best interest in mind.",1
"The hospitals and every other organizations that pushed them into this should be sued for everything they have and the money from that should go towards what we can do to help these people, including reconstructive procedures- laser removal of facial hair and so forth.

"WHERE ARE THE PARENTS???!!! This is heartbreaking, but these are CHILDREN! I can not wrap my mind around a parent who would allow their child's body to be mutilated in this way. My daughter wanted a tattoo and body piercings. I told her that while she was my responsibility she would not alter her body. Once she became an adult, if it was something she still wished to do then I would happily support her. But I guarantee you that if THIS is what she'd been asking for, I'd have scoured the continent for ANY non-woke mental health professional that would treat the underlying psychological issue driving such a request. This insanity HAS GOT TO STOP.  Matt is absolutely right - this decade, starting with the BLM riots, will be defined by the mass formation psychosis that culminated in what amounts to child sacrifice.",0

"I would be inclined to think that you are exaggerating, and that this is a phenomenon on the fringes of society, except for the fact that my own 13-year old has SIX transgender girls (now 'boys') in her grade, in a rural school.

They simply don’t know the horrifying truth that’s exposed by these posts, and I think that if they were made aware of this side of the coin. I guess I just ascribe to the “don’t attribute to malice what you can to stupidity” argument, but stupidity here is more like ignorance.",0
Shattering,0
Unfortunately Reddit mods will do everything in their power to discredit or outright censor these stories,0

"I remember posting a link to a detransitioner's story on FB, but my FB friends simply said that they DID NOT BELIEVE those stories. They said the stories were made up by hateful right wing sources and that I should be ashamed of myself for linking to such hateful lies. I was shocked at their intransigence. The main stream media needs to publish these stories, only then will supporters actually believe that the stories are true.",1
It really sucks to have dumb parents,0
"The detrans subreddit is a heartbreaking cautionary tale. It should be mandatory reading for all parents. I read and then I say prayers for the children and young adults who are suffering so deeply. I fear that some will never recover. I used to believe that the trans suicide rate was due to a lack of acceptance. Now I know better so I pray as hard as I can. Dear God, please wrap them in your loving arms and keep them safe from the monsters who wear faces of concern.",1
There was a time when I thought about transitioning. Glad I never did it. Love being a woman,1
"Matt i was with you until you began calling those who push the trans agenda evil and much more. These people are confused, as we all are when it comes to this stuff, and they're leading with their compassion attribute maxed out. It's a relatively new problem that we're trying to figure out as a society and the people who think that transitioning is the solution aren't de-facto evil because of the horrors of the stories you read. Stories which nearly brought me to tears, by the way. I cannot imagine the pain these people are in. For the pro-transitioners, they, misguidedly, truly think the ends justify the means, and that the 'ends' are desirable as they see them through heavily rose tinted glasses. They believe they're doing the right thing. I can list many reasons why calling these people evil is un/counterproductive, but it's the type of rhetoric that only makes people dig their heels in on both sides. But thank you for covering these stories. We need honest discussion and all information and possible outcomes to be told in full before these disaffected people make such a massive, consequential, and irreversible decision. And before you started the name-calling, i was just thinking to myself that this might be a good video to refer to a friend who may think differently about this than i do",0

"When I was 14-15 years old, I fell for this. I thought I was a boy because I was hanging around a cult-like crowd. My mom sent me to a therapist.   He was an older man. And he asked, “Why?

"How can it be entirely the fault of the parents when teen do stuff behind parents back?   There are soooooo many broad generalization made over attachment to identity.   Parents should explain to kids throughout their life that NOTHING IS PERMANENT. Not identify, not our lives. Work backwards. Talk about death - something that is permanent. All the rest is attachment. That's about the best one can do.   All of this personal victim mentality seems like a competition to see who has the most tragic story.   Theater of the absurd.",0
L BOZO TROONS,1
To that first girl all I can say is it wasn't your fault. You were wronged. People who should have known better let that happen or worse yet wanted it to happen. They should be ashamed and they should be stopped from ever doing it again. They should be punished. You are not at fault.,0
The reason this has happened and I truly believe in my heart is that the people pushing this and doing this to these kids are pedophiles! It's sad because more people are going to come out hurting because of this transition that these pedophiles keep pushing on kids. This needs to end before more kids are going to be hurt. And the one mistake they did was once you messed with the kids you unite every race together to fight against that. I'm Puerto Rican of sick to my stomach knowing that these pedophiles are destroying our kids our future. Truly believe they're just trying to cut down population I'm about taking away the chance of producing kids cuts population. 💯😢 💔🙏💔🤬,0
"It's disgusting the way these ""doctors"" lie to parents and tell them their kids will commit suicide if they don't allow them to medically ""transition"".  It's emotional blackmail and a blatant lie.   Any data that makes it through the trans / woke blockade shows the exact opposite.  I.e. that messing with their hormones and mutilating their bodies is more likely to cause suicide than prevent it.",1

"It's only recently that I came across your channel and saw you break down the queer nuances of the Dead Poets Society. I must tell you, as a queer person who seems to incessantly scan for homosexual subtext, it was immensely liberating to find - and here comes the phrase - that I'm not alone. I adore the fact that you provide a socio-philosophical basis for your content because it helps me reframe queerness as something that doesn't only concern my own (individual) self-perception, but which is so packed with social influence. I can't thank you enough for the distinction made between queer integration into heteronormative social order vs. the restructuring and reshaping of the social order - it gives so much perspective. Sociology articulates the queer condition so succintly and beautifully, doesn't it? Again, I can't thank you enough, for both the content you produce and its inspiring logistics and conclusions :)",0
"Another comment about how this applies in the asexual and aromantic communities: I've seen people asking stuff like ""what do aces/aros wear?"" since other queer communities have their own styles (eg. bi ppl and doc martens). I always felt that it was kind of inherently exclusionary to suggest that styles of dress correspond to different sexual orientations (especially is they don't develop organically irl), since not everyone is going to like those styles, but I hadn't thought about the classist angle. This was a great eye-opening marxist queer video as always.",0
"About the asexuals not having a music preference:  there was a post on the asexual subreddit asking aces what type of music we like and the overwhelming majority said ""metal."" I don't know why, maybe it's because aces who are on reddit are more likely to like metal or something?   I don't really like metal myself, but if anyone who is asexual and likes metal music could offer an explanation to this that would be great.",0

"So... I think this video is really wierd. I dont think is its necessarily bad though. I think so because lots of parts of this video confused me (like pretty much the first 8min) or what i think was attempted humor (this is a wierd thing to criticize because jokes are inherently at subjective) didnt land at all with me even though (i think) i recognized the jokes themselves and how they were ment to work. From the top of my head id say this video feels like it was made for an audiance/ community im just not part of and i dont know if this was delibreately done (for example as some sort of artistic choice) or if this might be a problem with the script.  Especially at the beginning i thought there was a strong lack of framing/explanation as for what is said. (like in the beginning i was confused to what even means gay music? Like music only gay people listen to? Or from gay people? Or music used in reference to pro LGBTQ movements? or just stereotypically gay? depending on the awnser to this question, id even have a few following questiions) And yes some of the things that confused me were later addresed and explained in the video but if i have to wonder (for 20min in the most extreme part of this) what was even meant in the introduction, the content in between (first mention and explanation through context) suffers from it. After watching the whole video im sadly not entirely sure what im supposed to take away from it and i think a lot of the video sounded like nonsense gibberish which is really sad because i can absolutely see a intelligent young guy who obvioulsly put a lot of work into this. All it took was a better structure/ framework/mabye even a little more explanation the video/script better to be more convincing. Well either this or i actually dont fit the audience this video was meant for. Also meaning id lack in basic knowledge of the topic. Which again would be sad because i think in there actually is a very interresting topic anyone could want to learn about (very subjective). (I recognize there is nothing wrong with putting out a video generally only ment for people who already have some basic knowledge of the topic. Pretty much all topics get very complex at a point.) I also dont like clarifying something by putting a text on the screen for not even a second to read. (in the beginning there once were only 5 frames of time to read! WTF man? do you want me to not watch the video or should i rater try to find the right frame to pause on and get annoyed? Like seriously why is the only ""context"" that was actually readable the 72 times boring written over the screen that didnt even say something other then please laugh) Please at least let the conText stay a few seconds on screen. Apart from that some statements are wierdly framed or debatable id say. However these dont really are a big problem as they generally werent really the focus of the argument but merely means to transition and a slight misrepresentation of some little facts shouldnt hurt anyone too much.",0

"As an asexual with a music taste that is literally all over the godamed place, yeah, I don't seem to have any specific leaning (i.e. ""attraction"") towards any particular genre, it seems to be more like a merry-go-round with several genres switching out depending on my current mood. One more datapoint for you that is technically useless (or is it?) I  could  say that I am partularly leaning towards ""video game music"" and ""movie/series soundtracks"", but since those are technically just subsets of ""world music"", ""electronic music"" and ""classical music"" depending on the individual album itself, I still cannot find any leaning towards any specific genre. Also, I don't like the new contemporary pop music, so I wouldn't even like to listen to the ""Deserved"" playlist. Not to mention the fact that I don't even use spotify. (probably because I am too ancient (90's kid) and stick to CD-rips and downloaded mp3's) Also, I do guess another influence would be from which country or even just what continent someone is from, because there's specific cultural practices that don't necessarily stick to one's ""race"" (as a German native speaker it's really weird using that word, even in English) or ethnic group, but also to one's physical living space.",0

"So how does Spotify manufacture Gay culture? I watched the entire video and can't tell; you went on an entire rant about how gay culture came to be in general and how Spotify has curators but none of it answered the question you proposed in the title of the video. The playlist isn't even in the pride section of Spotify you displayed in the video, it was just some other playlist in that section that linked to it as ""if you like this you might like this as well, lol"". And none of these songs you showed in the video felt gay, or white or male to me either and as a Trans MtF bisexual I should be able to tell.",0

A single flannel or tucked in t-shirt doesn't always cut it. An over simplification of course, but I think the access to signifiers of ""queer identity"" or simply access to ""queer culture"" had some impact on my and others' willingness to come out.",0

"As a straight guy, I've always wondered why there is music specifically associated with LGBTQ+ people I mean does sexuality really give you an ascribed music taste? This video addresses this well.

"Neat, this has been on my mind. The mix of queer origins &amp; tastemakers and ‘gay’ as an identifiable element within a /personal brand makes me think how useful irony is.

"46:32 Being a kid was weird in that you don't have the money to consume (so not enjoying material cultural signals), but you have the affordability? to... enjoy free-ish cultural things? like music? that is curated by more well-off people? Or not. idk.  For me being gay (and the other LGBTQ+ stuff) just limits what I can listen to, by making certain songs more cringe, certain lyrics hated, and certain artists self-banned. No supporting homophobes. Not too much heterosexual love. Hatred of ""the one"" narrative and focus on marriage. Disgust towards gay bait. Maybe the positive effects (making me like certain music more) would be related to needing of empowerment, empathy with some of women's struggle, and celebration of ""this speaks only to the gays"" or ""gay struggles"" titles.  Conversations about what being gay when there's nothing inherently gay in it, seems very much like creating a culture that has an in and out group, and I really don't like that. That's like saying this is the way to be gay, other things are wrong. Which, not the best message. Not sure why gay people would do it, but I guess we do live in a Capitalist society. Why form a community based on bad practices when we can just form it based on shared struggles and joys you know? Joys that do not exclude people with shared struggles who feel at home with the same label as you. 🤞",0

"This video finally explained to me why I feel so disconnected with the stereotypical queer music culture, I'm a bi trans man and I mainly listen to black/death metal and metal music with heavy classical/jazz inspirations so I never felt like I was part of the queer community since I don't like a lot of stuff they seem to like, the effeminate gay men in my class love these pop divas so I never have any topic to talk with them bc it just feels like we are not even part of the same ""LGBTQ"" community",0

"At the beginning I thought the first song sounded gay because it could be set to retro gay porn. And I thought the second song sounded straight, or at least more so, because it seems like pretty generic EDM fare that's trendy with the kids around here who like to go to ""raves"".",0
"Sixteen years old me had a lot of trouble with that. The only way I could be close with the gay community was on Grindr meme page on Instagram, and I can tell you that pop music and women pop artist are discussed a lot on it, mostly cause (I find) Instagay is mostly dominated by Californian muscular white gay men who typically listen to this.  It was really invalidating to me, as a young, not really in shape and French trans man, cause I was discovering metal (especially black metal) at the time and I couldn’t relate to any of these memes or jokes. I do liked some lady Gaga songs and grew up with my sister blasting Britney Spears but it wasn’t enough.   The funny part is that, a few months ago, I realized that I’m more bi than gay and some aspect of my music taste fit with the bi stereotypes… even if the majority of the songs that I like are listened by cis straight men (underground rap, metals being at the top of my most listened genre)",0

"I haven't finished but if I'll probably forget if I don't comment now, I think there's a missing angle here. The AIDs crisis of the 80s had a dramatic impact on which side of the coin was leading the national movements. Act Up and associated movements that were on the left and had a lot of grass roots, lower income power behind them, numbers of invested individuals rather than numbers in the bank. The rich white gay men who survived due to easier access to medicine or lessened exposure due to restricted circles of exposure and an inclination to only screw their metaphorical cousins in the community, once these men took over the leadership positions and pushed out those remaining lower income originating or left leaning voices we end up with people like Mayor Pete Buttigieg, the extremely wealthy ultra capitalists who use their sexuality without being part of it's community.",0

"Interesting material and something I've been thinking about, but from a different perspective. I am a cis monogamous heterosexual, but my whole life have been drawn more into the transgressive and subversive parts of the queer culture (and I do enjoy ""energetic dance pop"", but it's not my no1 thing). As a teenager, I grew up mostly listening to punkrock and hanging around squats in Eastern Europe, but in my 20s I changed my tastes and started attending queer parties and clubs associated with all kinds of aspects of underground culture and music (like in the style of Posession techno or for a more mainstream example - Berghain style underground clubs and parties). I always enjoyed people there, the overall vibe, freshness and originality, breaking of the social norms, and always felt welcome - never as an intruder/appropriator of the culture. Even some of my daily clothing or piercing is considered by some of my friends ""queer"". Much later in my life I moved to the US and unsurprisingly, I enjoyed a lot living in Castro in SF, and now in NYC in Bushwick.  So in this way, some aspects of the social construct of queerness have definitely gone beyond sexuality and orientation, but it's not just commodified, happy upbeat pop music. I'm not a sociologist and not equipped to analyze it properly, but it seems to me that there is this aspect of queer culture that I've been drawn to is almost the opposite of the consumerist affluent ""gayness"" - breaking of some social norms (again - especially in Eastern Europe where I grew up, where LGBT people still don't enjoy many most basic rights it is breaking many norms and puts LGBT folks as a target of hate) comes with broader breaking of other norms which makes it fresh, interesting, and original. ""Queer clubs are the place where the new culture happens"" could be said about the 70s NYC disco scene, 80s Detroit techno scene, or today various parties in Berlin, NYC, Paris, but also my home town of Warsaw.  Maybe I am a cultural intruder? How much of attempted allyship and sharing experiences becomes appropriation?  Would love to hear your thoughts about it.",0

"As adorable as this clout-grab is (terrible methodology BTW) this ends up being worse that what you're accusing Spotify (etc) of doing.

"Fascinating video. I don't know how it factors in, but I know a part of my tastes results from not growing feeling like I was a part of the queer community. I didn't even know what transgender was until my 20s. By the time I came out I was 32, so even though I'm a gay man I have 3 decades of being treated like a straight woman that was kind of gender nonconforming.  Most of the time when someone says that X is gay, I usually don't agree. I recognize something to be queer-coded, but that doesn't mean it's actually queer. A lisp isn't queer. It's just one form of coding.",0

"For the asexuals, if I were to hazard a guess, there aren’t many songs in any genre that are “relatable”, given that many songs have sexual undertones. So there’s a lot of genre bouncing.  Or maybe it would be better analyzed by romantic attraction than sexual. (Though I assume there would be similar results for aromantics)",0
"I think one thing you missed in the cultural signifiers sections, where you mentioned iced coffee and corduroy was the aspect of doing things intentionally outside of the norm in one's aesthetic. Like AFAB people drawing on a mustache or shaving their heads, or AMAB people wearing high femme makeup. Yes, these things do cost money, but arguably you can get a buzz cut and a few basic makeup items for pretty cheap, so do they fall into the same consumerist category? There seems to be a spectrum.",0
"The point about queer cultural signifiers being restricted to the class of people who can afford them is well taken. Reminds me of my own hesitancy to come out as non-binary due to the financial strain of buying enough cultural signifiers to create what would be socially recognized as non-binary. Now that I have more disposable income, I'm actually able to create an aesthetic with fashion and makeup that I feel more fully represents myself, and has the lovely side-effect of causing strangers to default to they/them pronouns without me asking. I love that I'm actually able to afford to create this aesthetic that I feel is more fully me. It's quite interesting to consider the cultural implications of the individualist and consumerist expression of queerness vs. the collective power expression of queerness.",0
"This is very well researched, well put together, and entertaining. Very excited to see what you continue to produce!",0
"These results are fascinating (finding a negative correlation for queer people liking with the music styles in Deserved), but one thing you may be missing is the specific artists and songs. Perhaps Madonna and Lady Gaga have special qualities other than ""happy dance music"" that are appealing to gays.",0

I am a late transitioning trans woman and found music to be a really big part of discovering myself.   Rather than rely on playlists, I found artists who were openly queer and for a time listened to nothing but that.    Queer people can be found in lots of genres, even more obscure ones like doom metal (Vile Creature, Bodyvoid) or steampunk (Steam Powered Giraffe).   But if I was looking for songs specifically about queer (and specifically trans)  things, Spotify quickly categorized my ""daily mix"" into sad queer and angry queer and honestly not a lot else.   I also noticed that there were some songs that always got pushed (""They, Them, Theirs"" by the Worriers, for example, always seemed to be in the list) while other bands barely get in the mixes (We Are the Union, an awesome ska band).",0

"Great video! If I have one criticism though, it's that this video seems to focus on queerness as sexuality (especially in the survey as it did not ask any questions about transness), and while this video is studying a type of music I typically associate with cis gay men, the exclusion of transness as a factor does erase a large part of the community that while foundational is often overlooked.",0

"This is just a suggestion but I think that it might be helpful to add a conclusion of your thoughts/opinion/finding at the end of your videos along with the thought pieces you leave behind for your audience to think about because, I think I got the message of this video: that queer culture as we understand it is defined by the taste of the middle and upper class, because, queerness, having no physical markers, is expressed through consumer purchases, and that the tastemakers who defined this ""queer culture' are apart of these economic groups, and so act as a echo chamber that repeat, amplify, and solidify these experiences and taste because they have the power to do so. But by the end of this video, I don't know if I have misunderstood anything, or if I have missed anything because there's no clear, ""this is the conclusion"". Obviously it can be more subtle or nuance than that but you get the picture. I like expressing what I learn from your videos to my friends because as someone who is not a sociology student, I find the lessons in your videos Insightful, entertaining, and informative, but I do want to make sure I am expressing your idea's correctly, and not changing the intended messages of these video essays. For example, I don't know if one of your messages was that the taste that define the 'queer community', and which come from upper or middle class, are representative of the white upper and middle class or weather these taste seem to be present in the upper and middle class as a whole, regardless of race or ethnicity?",0
"I'm a straight guy (ik, cringe) and I laughed when I saw that bisexual people are more likely to listen to punk. Based on what I've seen, that's true lol. My friend is dating a bi girl now and I was excited cause I thought she'd like punk (like every other bi person I've met) and I would ask her if she listened to these bands and she said no and she didn't care much for any recommendations I gave. She just listens to Harry Styles all day. There's probably a lesson about stereotypes in there somewhere",0
Seriously......that's a solid Samsonite suitcase......but the TV is pure Envy,0
"Thank you for your hard work Alex, this video is very insightful and informative. This topics about taste, music and class have always been in the back of my mind and I can't quite describe it, your video helps me to conceptualize them perfectly. This must take you a lot of research to be done and also the effort going into the background is stunning! Keep up the great work man!",0
not me opening the app when the sound came on 😭,0
"i, a bi, do like punk. but i wondered what the connection is between that and rap, my favorite genre. both are rhythm centered and anti-oppression. maybe we listen to them because we are angry about trying to fit ourselves into the het mold? amazing video!! all the gorgeous sets",0

"A little hot take: maybe this 'pop obsessed gay' stereotype is male gaze and nostalgia combined?  I'm a non-binary AMAB who grew up with a Christian conservatory mother and up until plague years I saw myself as this flamboyant gay brazilian boy. But when I was a kid, I was not allowed to watch queer content on the Internet or television. I was kept away from most of it for most of my childhood and yet I really loved pop music. All this performative, flawless, sexy pop girl concept really stuck with me throughout the years and part of me still loves the appeal in a non-sexual way, even though I mostly listen to indie rock nowadays.  Recently, I was watching a video about 'queer time'. It talked about how we, as queer people tend to miss or disregard most of the work-marry-buyhouse-havekids mentality that is forced upon heteronormative society, which in turn makes us feel like we're not aging. Maybe the way that we consume pop music has to do with this eternal teenage/young adult way of feeling?  Maybe I'll edit this later to further elaborate, this was just rambling",0
I was very surprised to see a video titled like this one showing up in my feed lmao sounded like alt right trash! Glad i clicked it out of curiosity,0
"why would someone listen to a cultural intermediary if they cant relate to them, its not being forced down their throat.

"The meaning of behavior and appearance  also varies with location. ""Obviously gay"" looks very different in different cities/countries/cultures. I was once at a club when a Bob Marley song came on.

"Trying to form a culture around a feature that's evenly distributed across all of humanity is pretty futile unless that culture has unique ritual and customs attached to it. Thus why ""fans of a certain activity, piece of media, political concept"" can hold a culture while ""diabetic people"" cannot. Frankly the very idea of ""diabetic people music"" sounds pretty insulting, doesn't it? I personally hold the same idea for any notion of LGBT culture. Our only bonding activities are choosing atypical sexual partners and having metaphorical rocks chucked at us by society, both of which are the lowest hanging of fruit to form any sort of cameraderie around. It's like shoving everyone who likes icecream in a room together and expecting to get along because they like icecream.  Frankly it's kind of astonishing that a group of people who wants to be seen as people silmultaniously is aghast every time the notion that being considered people comes out with the reminder that ""people"" is a broad umbrella that contains people of wildly different varieties.",0

Missing the wood from the trees.",0
excellent!,0
You’re such a great writer! So glad I stumbled upon this vid!:),0
It's so interesting! I always concluded that these editorial playlists were made in part with the algorithm? (I'm not that tech savvy lol) But knowing that these playlist are made by actual people makes a lot of more sense now. It's interesting how Spotify decides to sorta push that detail to the shadows? I mean we as an audience do not have info on the editors. We don't have that natural moment of drawing a conclusion as when we see the picture of an editor-in-chief of a magazine or read the about the author part of a book.,0
"for the entirety of the first half of the video i was thinking to myself ""none of these songs on this playlist appeal to me, i'm more of a punk rock type of person"" and i was expecting to not relate to the results of your second survey, and then you went on to say bisexuals were more likely to like punk rock! i feel validated and called out, lol. this was a fantastic video, i love your insight and the new direction in content!",0
"Great video Alexander! I like the new direction of the channel. The international LGBT history in the early 20th century is something I'm ignorant about, your video was super interesting!",0
"This is a super interesting topic because as a lesbian, i HATE the sad girl playlist that’s targeted towards sapphics. There are a few artists and songs on there that i genuinely enjoy but would never lump together like that. It’s just so hard to find sapphic artists who are mainstream who don’t make sad songs about their relationships / someone else",0
"Being from outside north america (but still ostensibly white european, just not the currently prosperous germanic or saxon variety) I wish I could pinpoint this phenomenon so clearly to marketing and capitalism, but I simply can not - because while I clearly see that there is a marketing drive to exploit existing tastes, there is also most importantly, a rich history of gender discourse that pulls gay men into adoration of feminine-coded innocent unseriousness. The answer is CAMP! What does a boy do faced with exclusion by their masculine peers but strong enough to embrace unashamed rejection of such standards... So yeah, where is the discussion of camp on this piece? Aren't some of these songs just camp? Where is the obvious Susan Sontag reference to tell us about the campness in ballet? What is ""fruity"" mean but camp? Is it more than just tastemaking, but also attitude - why is a shy gay less 'gay'? Why do I dance like a straight guy? In some way, I actually think the most american thesis possible is really the one presented here - to think that capitalism is the tastemaker. Nah. Capitalism is just the selling of a prepackaged recognizable gay signal, which we like because it's convenient to code eachother, but which we don't crave because it is incredibly limiting -&gt; camp was never meant to mean gay. But we need to acknowledge that this is our own valuing here, and that broadening our perception of queerness is our responsibility, but also understand that it makes it less recognizable and identifiable and it devalues it as a signifier.",0

They can fuck up the planet however they like and we're supposed to pay ourselves out of it with the little money we have in comparison and recycle what cannot be recycled bc the necessary infrastructures aren't there!?

This is a very american-cenrtic terminology, actual Caucasians aren't even considered white in slavic european countries and are subjected to racism in Russia for example. Not even mentioning the racist roots of this term coined by a racist pseudo-scientist. Honestly, when will this end. Besides that, great video, made me better understand cultural capital and how to apply it in modern society. Anyway, best wishes from Georgia, Caucasus.",0

As someone with a masters degree in data analytics. I felt you when you said “i ran a logistical regression whatever the hell that is”. Also those regression results…you’re right they were some sexy regression results,0
"Don't get me wrong, i enjoyed the video and it definitely left me with many interesting ideas to chew on.   but i feel like this analysis is missing a focus on gender.  in our general patriarchal culture, a women liking female artists and 'girly' things is normal, but her liking male artists and 'manly' things isn't weird, it's pretty much just as normal or even socially advantageous. looking up to dudes is fine and neutral for anyone.   but a man liking female artists and 'girly' things is socially mocked and stigmatised. it's seen as a huge question mark on his masculinity and maleness. liking feminine shit is seen as frivolous and shallow when women do it and ludicrous or even devious when men do it. liking a woman's art, especially a woman's highly feminine art, is deeply subversive to the male social role, so only men who are already outside the bounds of excepted male norms - openly gay and/or overtly feminine men - stand to loose nothing further by embracing it. therefore transforming otherwise cishetero normative, incredibly popular female artists into 'gay icons' bc of the stand-out visibility of the queer men in their fanbases.   that's why Deserved is gay, bc it's just highlighting popular feminine culture. there isn't a lesbian equivalent, bc there's nothing in the world a girl can express admiration for (other than expressly queer content) that queers her gender in the same way.    (i love your channel and you a lot ❤ i'm not hating i just didn't find the correlation very mysterious to begin with. but i found everything you said to be spot on in explaining why random shit like iced coffee is declared gay culture..)

My issue with “gay music” is that they really mean gay effeminate men who party a lot. It’s the opposite of what stereotypical lesbian music is. Exactly what the first survey responder said.,0

I suspect because of language barrier they only hear is as a slow uwu love song, and not the lyrics. What's also funny is that I don't get his appeal, despite him as literal gay he is.   My coming out music was Evanescence funny enough, because my junior high school era was filled with gay confusion because straight bully/classmates often jokingly flirted me for some reason, so the songs I identified with were angry women like Amy Lee, Emilie Autumn, Epica (bonus that I had a bias against 'machinemade music', which was bollocks but I was 14 sue me). Funny enough current musicians like Rina Sawayama and Dorian Electra brought those music elements and mix them with  'gay music' so I guess my music taste is gay again?",0

"The aesthetics and references in this video are ""upper-middle class"" and ""Western"" and ""white"" (which is not a bad thing necessarily).

"I think a big part of what is considered ""gay music"" is just what drag queens like to perform (I specified queens instead of kings because there isn't a codified music genre associated with them yet due to them not being as mainstream). These are songs that play at gay bars, not what loads of gay people listen to on their own. They're also genres that were popular with POC LGBT+ people decades ago and took time to reach the white LGBT+ tastemakers, so I imagine the average non-tastemaker LGBT+ people have moved on to other genres by now.",0

I've always been into niche and weird stuff, at least from a western perspective. My music taste hasn't changed in the past nearly 11 years since I've started listening to VOCALOID music.

"As an aromantic-asexual person, I really liked this for a lot of reasons. The history part with the two different ways queer culture could exist was interesting to me, because even if most gay people I know don’t like ideas of community as much, I didn’t know they used to. Nowadays the idea of physical queer communities is what a lot of aromantic want (without wanting a spouse, a nuclear family unit is far from ideal) because society deems romance as the best human connection. So when aros don’t have that, community and friendship seem very appealing. Also, as most of queer culture is geared towards allo queer people, it’s easy to feel isolated form it. Like queer anthems don’t resonate with me much. Better than straight, but not close to my experience as a queer person.",0

"I’ve never been a huge fan of music that stereotypically is associated and enjoyed by people of my demographic: that being teenage lesbians. I think this might be considered blasphemy but I cannot stand Girl In Red’s music. I think that associating certain interests or tastes with any culture leads to nothing but a feeling of deep alienation and eventual separation, which I would say defines my opinion of the LGBTQ community pretty well. While personally I have a good paying job where I work myself half to death and could probably afford to dress and consume the media that people of my demographic are supposed to be into, I simply do not want to. I don’t relate to the wider culture of queer people my age, as much as used to wish I did, because the wider canon of “gay interests” is just a whole array of things I am absolutely not interested in. These kinds of algorithms seem like the capitalist incarnation of the social alienation that I used to feel, back when I thought forcing myself to have similar interests with queer people my age would give me a sense of belonging and community.",0

"This is totally interesting video but the fact that the age factor here was largely glossed over in the statistical research portion - by no fault of your own since this was highly dependent on your audience reach and the responses you recieved - stands out quite a lot to me. As a Black queer nonbinary sapphic watcher over 30, one of the most obvious factors in discussing cultural gayness is whether or not you experienced formative queerness moments pre- or post- social media. All-in-all, though, this was a really cool look at how capital-driven tastemaking works around marginalized cultural identities.",0
Love this video!!! Thank u,0
"To me, music is all about putting yourself into a mindset and an immersion. I honestly don't casually listen to a single bit of ""Queer"" (pop, electronic, dance, whatever we wanna classify it) classified music, and I don't really enjoy it artistically or musically. I absolutely listen to it at the gym or in a group setting because the fulfillment I receive is that of community.   But I'm still listening to orchestral works, Linkin Park, and videogame soundtracks.",0

"Truth Told To Feeble Minds  This false view of stability, within the minds of human entities, is quite staggering to say the least. It's as if they lack the capacity to comprehend  this fabricated reality.  As if, to them everything is as it should be. And, more importantly,  the thought of it collapsing seems to be something they can't vision nor see. Though the times in which these minds were cultivated,  is unprecedented. Still they find themselves unable to deem this reality as one absent thought of stagnancy.  As they attempt to seek a life lived by forms once seen. By those one might call, family.  But, what's most interesting is even within such thoughtlessness as it relates to what one might deem the ""greater good"". These individuals in question deem themselves to be special,  which in turn changes culture to simply mirror one's self.  This selfish view of existence,  has truthfully never existed.  At the very least, it's never been this prevalent. To have a being absent merit,  deem themselves as one to teach. To have a platform in which, millions,  they can reach. To be able to regurgitate ideas to a sea of minds, allowing each of these minds to think alike. Has only taken place within nations and religion. Now  a ""Chris"", ""Stacey"", or ""Tim"", can compel individuals at will to feel as they feel. To do as they do. Allowing for the formulation of singular truth. This type of truth inacts homogeneous tribalism. Where as the simplicity of society is broken down entirely. And,  each individual,  each and every constituent,  see themselves as not human or American. But,  only what their tribe, states. The malleability in humanity is plainly seen. As so called ""influencer's"" forge new truth inside of these human's brain. Creating new ways for them to see themselves,  as they. For now, everyone has a group in which they claim. And,  along with that group, truth!",0

That's nothing new . I'm waiting for this plague to cease or lessen . It is easier to connect when you find common grounds with people not create more titles and boundaries to separate yourself . At the end of the day, let's just hope none of this is pushed on future generations ( let people raise their own children and don't force ideology on them)  and allow people to respectfully decline you forcing your ideology on them . There was a young person who said thst if you don't refer to them by their pronouns you will not refer to the person at all . Childish . Give someone your name and they can use that . It's easy .

"12:30 so you’re expecting 240 million Americans to change the way they talk by referring to a person in a plural way which further more confuses the entire conversation because…. Your feelings are hurt?? Am I getting that right? You want the entire American population to reverse everything that they were taught at school since kindergarten by talking like this: “oh yea they helped me” “I can’t remember if it was them” when the conversation is about ONE person. Do you not see how confusing that can be? The first question anyone will ask is wait which people are you talking about. Then you have to sit there and explain that you’re referring to that person as they them. Any normal human with a brain will not be able to get over the sheer stupidity of that attempt to pluralize a person. Couldn’t you people come up with a different word that hasn’t been used in a way for thousands of years? Heck you could’ve used alien, or even made up a word fico for male and fica for woman and even that would’ve been ok. But you expect me to change the way I was taught English because you’re wearing earrings? Furthermore, in your example you don’t even explain to the person you are talking to. You just correct that person by simply saying “they” or “them” as if they will pick up their “mistake”. In conclusion you can’t expect for every person to have the same mindset as you. I’m very knowledgeable in football. But when someone saids “the guy with the ball ran and went to the other end of the field”, I’m not going to get angry and say THE RUNNING BACK!!

"I swear to god, some of these are valid like saying I’m gay, I’m Lesbian, I’m bisexual, or I go by they/them.  But those are as far as I go.  Allllll the rest of these “Neo Genders”, and especially the “Neopronouns” are stupid AF and are literally people just trying to be “Different” from the rest of their community.  Like I’m 100000% certain that 99.9% of these people are just saying this shit for attention.  They come up with the terms “Neopronouns” to stand out, because LITERALLY nothing about them is interesting, so they decide to make their “Gender” their WHOLE FUCKING IDENTITY, and if you call them out for how stupid a “Neopronoun” like fucking clown and clown self are (yes,some on TikTok ACTUALLY wants to be called fucking CLOWNSELF), they go Batshit crazy and fucking cancel you and call you fucking homophobic and shit.  There are two genders,  Male and Female, THATS IT.  If you don’t think any of them apply to you, for whatever reason, use They/Them, but that’s it.  There is literally no convincing reason why you need to go by Thin/Thiney, Zey/Zem, Dem/Demy,  Nipo, Nipa, or use fucking “Demon pronouns.” If you have a penis you’re a boy, and if you don’t feel like a boy, then fine, that means your a girly boy, nothing wrong with that.  However you don’t need to fucking change your GOD DAMN DNA, and Biological structure, to become a girl.  Same thing goes with women.  This is what happens to a generation that was raised on the internet.  I’ve experienced it first hand, I have Nephews who live with me for 2 years, and there mom didn’t deal with there issues, and just plopped then in front of a screen.  They were 4 and 6 years old and they already had a phone.  These fuckers we’re entitled AF, but my moms a teacher and actually fixed them.  But unfortunately they went back to their mother and reverted back to being entitled little shits who yell at there parent and still get the shit they want.  My Generation is absolutely fucked.  I’m an atheist, but God Help Us.  This is the clown and clownself video so you guys can see I’m not making this shit up: https://youtu.be/GREUT0GxEf4",1

Why is it so import for everyone to be accepted by others when they can not accept the fact that they where born with having female or male parts get over them selves grow up take responsibility! Society is only going to take so much of this nonsense! I agree let people be what there going to be but don't complain about because your in love with a toaster! I am serious! Go be in love with you toaster but do not tell me to check my pronouns. Or you will find yourself in a situation! It extremely rude to tell someone what to think or say! I live in America and I believe in the Constitution of the United States of America! Go pursue your happiness until you step someone else's rights then we have a problem!,1
Everyone has pronouns y'all really need to actually look things up before you hate on people I swear. And some people like labels because it makes them feel valid in their identity.  Not everyone is into labels though and that's ok too. Just because you don't agree with the way someome sale lives their life or understand it doesn't give you an excuse to be an a hole!,0

So everybody has to respect their pronouns? Well doesn't that work both ways? If everyone has to respect their pronouns then they in turn have to respect everyone else's opinions and views on how they perceive everyone else's gender. If your male biologically I'm going to call you a guy. If you are a female I'm going to call you a girl. Plain and simple. This trend is getting old. If we never had social media this whole gender dysphoria crap never would have came to be.,1

25:14 important moment: female they/she says she doesn't mind if you call her she and she'll still feel noticed. But don't call her she if you're a straight person. This reflects a darker underlying premise that this specifically millenial/gen z crowd is not only forcing their demands but outright resent straight people. Again my point about transhumanist anti-family agenda. And in turn an anti-procreation society which will pair nicely with plummeting fertility.,1

This is what happens when kids teach each other and don't trust their own parents. So they learn from the weird uncle or cousin in the family and become weirder and weirder because they find like minds on the internet instead of getting bullied at school lol,0

They have lost out on almost everything- they have no productive ambitions, they feel no connection with a higher purpose (whether through religion or Science or philosophy) and they definitely lack practical understanding of the world. I wonder what they do to run their homes. It is dangerous to be outrun by irrationality and loneliness that one finds a sense of solidarity by morphing their reality. Sad. Very sad.",0

The black community, George Flloyd, and other countless minorities' stories need to be addressed in the brilliant way you communicate injustice through your comedy.  Please do not let one community, you see they the trans community never speak out about Haitians at the border or blacks in the South, still being lynched.  They are not offended by any other group, but the ones that have been oppressed, black minorities.  Please get your facts to attract.  You are coming after minorities that you don't agree with.  Look at you're elected officials, you are not coming after them like you are coming for Dave Chapelle.  . Although any other group has not tried to silence you, not mentioning any other group but themselves that are offended and are trying to censor you, you come after Chapelle?.  Finally, you do not have to watch, listen or agree with what Chappelle has to say.

"In other words, Dave Chappelle has done what every entrepreneur has dreamed about doing: “If you build it, they will come!” Chappelle built it, they came—and we are staying.   Chappelle’s stand is not an act of power without worth. His stand is an act designed by worth, candor, power, money, and support for moving beyond the noise of relevance. If Chappelle continues with the prudence he has applied thus far, he will establish a stay of earning reverence beyond his skill of being funny. #Relevance2Reverence",0

It is not trans exclusive, it is male exclusive. Women who identify as men are included in radical feminism. ET also claims that he made derogatory comments about gender...no, he didn't. Saying that sex is a fact and that we should listen to women first in conversations about gender is not ""derogatory"", rather the opposite.",1

People, you better wake up to the  fact that it is ""fear"" that has become your god, and the angels of this god are all found throughout the media who literally hold your ""attention"".  Rightly so has the bible said: ""Whatsoever a man thinks, SO IS HE"".  You folks have no idea about the fact that you are not your own person.

I’m white and we have been the but of many a Chappell joke. not white not black brown Asian male or female rich or poor left wing or right wing of any other group i can think of has ever once been offended or cause a stir about Chappell. He even made fun of the KKK one time and to my knowledge they didn’t even claim to be offended. Think about that, even the KKK wasn’t upset when a black man made an entire skit making fun of then, or if that were we didn’t hear about it. But trans people get mad? It’s a JOKE people... what kind of comedy can exist if making jokes about people is off the table? If someone pointed out to me that the KKK was more “tolerant” of comedic and artistic liberties than the people I identified with I’d say it might be time to do some reevaluation of my peers...

"Wish I could address the Trans Community, he made fun of different races, ethnicities, cultures, women. Even Russell Peters made jokes on disabled people and gay Indians, no one said shit about that. Why do you think that you are better than anyone else, somehow untouchable by an art form that is built on by expressing the darker and comical parts of all peoples. Our flaws unite us, it shouldn't break us apart. In Jungian Analytic Psychology, it is said that when someone cannot laugh at themselves that that is an indication of insecurity. If you can't can't laugh at the darker parts of yourself, then you lack humility, perhaps the greatest of human virtues, something Dave has clearly mastered. Remember, it wasn't Dave Chappelle who killed that trans-woman, it was the trans community themselves. So, whose the real victim here? I think the trans-community needs to look deeply into themselves, because this is clearly an issue beyond Dave Chappelle or even comedy. You have to learn to love yourself, because no one can doubt that it's hard to come out of the closet in this patriarchal society and you are a people who have had it probably worst for centuries. There are clearly a lot of trans-generational issues here that need be solved before we start questioning the nature of Comedy, which has has been this way since time and will not bend to your unconscious sense of false-superiority. We are all equal, isn't equality what you strive for? Then that would mean you should be subject to comedy like all other marginalized communities. Your struggle is no more special than the struggles of mankind throughout history. So, by all due respect, get off your high-horse for once and speak to Dave Chappelle at our level, if you still have the courage to",1

I'm a gay man and I am having a hard time understanding what did he say that was offensive? Dave's jokes when they were talking of black people they were never offensive or other groups why is this outrage? If we are saying this group cannot be talked about because they are trans if this is not hate filled and we are talking in the context of comedy all of us are equal opportunity in this setting,0

Dave chappelle turns off his comments on all his pics / posts ...he prolly doesn't wanna see any comments,0
"Dave Chappelle is a brilliant comedian and likely a decent human being. I don't know him personally.  But I respect his comedy sense and what he has achieved.  All humans of good character deserve to live their lives.  We don't choose our gender among other characteristics.  But to cancel individuals or groups who poke fun or critique cultural mores is counterproductive.  We respect you, Dave, for your integrity as a comedian and likely for your humanity.",0
"Wait a second… I am confused.. if someone speaks  their mind in humor, no one can joke anymore at all? I don’t get it! Why can’t we just be people?",0
People are way too sensitive these days. How is it ok to make yo momma and fat jokes? But you can't about a person's gender! Bro a joke is a joke get over your damn selves seriously!!,1
People have become way to sensitive maybe should of kept that peen 😂😂😂 jk don't cancel me,0
"DAVE CHAPPELLE IS RIGHT , and I'm a white guy from the south he makes fun of me all the time get over it",0
"I didn't watch it, I don't know the facts. But I'll say this, as a man who loves all, men a little more than women in relationship matters. In the gay community, there is too much going on. All these letters and  Acronyms and the breakdown of this type of person or that type of person... cis boom ba...! it is just way too much. Male/ female &amp; undecideds. If you must LABEL yourself,  OK let's go for that. Straight or gay or bi is all I've ever known by whole life. As a gay black man in America, all I want is to be allowed to live my truth without interference. I don't need anyone's approval! I respect you as human, vice versa! That's it! That's all!",1
"Such a sensitive, virtue-signaling, hypocrite of a nation!",0
🙄,0
Hey tell you what how about if it is offensive too you don't watch it.,0
This is a fart in a wind storm created by the media and small group of agitators.... if you watched the special you'd know this is BS... The pendulum will swing back hard... and that's the sad part.,0
"I love, respect trans, LGBTQ community &amp; also love Dave's comedy. Dave said nothing HATEFUL in The Closer. 🤷🏻‍♀️ Just jokes. Folks need to learn to laugh at themselves again. 🤦🏻‍♀️",0
How many trans work at Netflix? That's a story all by itself! You would boycott a place that has accepted so many of you!?,1
He'll no dave not canceled. love this man he's a comedic genius.,0
Everything was fine until he said he was team TERF. Jokes are jokes but those TERFs have some serious crazy ideas.,0
Did the workers get paid for that day?,0
He not wrong,0
You can't cancel Dave Chappelle...,0
I stand with Dave,0
"I’m sorry… but when we reached the point a politician can’t define what a woman is, we’ve gone too far somewhere… I’m all for trans rights as long as they don’t step on women’s rights.",1
For crying out loud… comedians make fun of the president of the United States TOO. It’s JUSt Comedy . Geeze.,0
Real women need to defend themselves from these crazy assholes,0
I’ve seen much more offensive content on Netflix. Everyone has a right and free will to have an opinion as long as it’s respectful. We don’t have to agree with everything &amp; that’s okay.,0
"I like the reference to Da Baby at the end. ""Lets Gooo""",0
MEN are MEN WOMAN are WOMAN. God did not make a mistake the mistake is when sin enters into the body of a human being and causes them to depart from sanity thinking they are something that they are not Satan has deceived the whole world unless these things repent they will bust hell wide open I call them things because they are an abomination to GOD's creation a man cannot become a woman and a woman cannot become a man no matter how much they deceive their small brains into thinking so. REPENT REPENT REPENT or BUST HELL OPEN!!!!!!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️,1
"Netflix employees were cool with cuties..shut the hell up you ignorant, hypocritical children..ruining a man's lively hood is no where near simple insults",0
Cool I agree with him,0
Funny. I’d get thrown off of YouTube for telling anti black jokes equivalent to Chappells anti trans jokes. No hypocrisy here at all. No sir. Poor victimized blacks. Wah wah wah.,0
Dave is a legendary icon!!! A funny one!,0
Never back down on what you believe in.,0
These snowflakes are some freaked out creeps,0
“All the work that trans people do” like what work u talkin bout,1
That Jonathan dude had his pronouns listed as they/he/she. What a sick sick world.,1
Equal rights equal fights (jokes),0
"once u let the minority become majority, it will go through mistakes of ex majority.  u may joke on jews on blacks on god on anything, but u just cant joke on lgbt thing. Why not?!  Thank God i live in Russia.   p:s: totally ok with lgbt, respect them as equals.",1
im  wit dave netflix is promoting extinction of humanity lolz,0
Oh good grief! There’s nothing offensive there. Anything that mentions that community is put on the front page to bring attention to themselves. Personally I don’t really care how they feel. I guarantee you that they don’t care how I feel. I am full of love and don’t judge anyone. It’s not my place. You know the old saying “fu** them if they can’t take a joke.”,0
Dave Chapelle is correct.,0
LGBQ community must be racist...lol,1
Shut up it’s a damn joke! So comedy is dead ?,0
"Comedians always roasting everybody, you name it, police, politicians, businessman, black, white, yellow, everybody. Why all of a sudden 1 group of people becoming very offended? I am sure they were laughing on all of the other jokes &amp; suddenly one joke is off limits? Grow up LGBT! Be fair",1
Love dave no matter wat .speak truth dave speak it,0
F..k Netflix for you're constant LGBT(Lying Group Broken Tool) propaganda.You can't manage a joke!no humor no future.,1
when dat bearded dude has a higher voice than my 9 year old niece...wtf,0
His standup highlighted how close minded some of the trans communty are. Something they should know all about,1
The community and Chappell have no beef. So when we gonna realize we’re being played to fight against each other??,0
Why are we letting these people makes our society's rules?? Their interest do not reflect the interests of the majority of people it makes absolutely no sense,0
Why are all theses gay people getting but hurt,1
"What a bunch of nonsense, these people are so sensitive. Get over it !",0
I've watched every one of his Netflix specials assholes and if you really listen to what he is saying hes not beaten down or coming down on the trans community big he gives it to everybody equally But cancel culture is just stuck on this topic at the moment because it's a popular one,0
Have these folks just taken out bits and pieces of his latest Netflix special then contextualize it incorrectly. He states why is it 'easy' to change gender but difficult for Casius Clay to change his name to Muhammad Ali. The root of this special is race inequality...,0
"""He Him Actor"" No duh I can tell by looking at you, don't need a subtitle lmao",1
"I don't like the narative used in your video there, we can see your ugly opinion.",0
"I'ma say it.  Let it be a white comedian using humiliating and derogatory humor towards the black community and there is outrage.  Let a cis black male get a Netflix show where he uses humiliating and derogatory humor towards the trans community and...silence  Nah even worse... Well ""he is just being himself"", ""they are being too sensitive"".  What is wrong for one is wrong for all. Just bc it's involves gender presentation instead of skin color, doesn't make it any less okay.   Just my two sense.   I like him as a comedian in general but just bc I support some art doesn't mean I will support it all.",0
These people need to grow a spine.  Comedians make jokes about Mexicans all the time.,0
An audience with you? Who the fuck do you think you are some kind of king?,0
"It’s crazy how one group thinks they’re are so special that they should be excluded from jokes.  “The level of ego""",0
The word is fucked😂,0
"Dave , I'm a old white ,Irish, and  straight,  short guy make all your jokes about me I promise I won't get offended or sue that should fix your problem!!!!",0
Pretty soon the straight “white man” will be a thing of the past.,0
Garbage woke,0
DC we support u,0
"It's a shame, Dave is a ""tells it like it is"" comedian. Interspersing moments of sincerity and observation between jokes. It's incredibly effective when it works, but falls flat when the ""truths"" are out of touch which is what happened here.",0
"It really annoys me how so many people say that he's being problematic because he keeps making trans jokes. The reason he does is because he makes fun of LITERALLY everyone. Hes made jokes about black people, Chinese people, Mexican people, and especially white people. The point is this dude makes fun of actually everybody, and the only reason he brought it up more in his most recent special is because trans people are the most outraged about it.",1
Dave continue to speak the truth and do not pay attention to those confused individuals who tries to push their thoughts and lifestyles on others. They want to have rights what those who do not agree with them have rights. It's time out for people pleasing. Enough is enough,0
"Wtf is lgbtq+/€,'jao and batman symbol . I am a 12 years old that identifies as 21 so i can walk in bar and drink rum . What the fuck is this shit you call freedom and democracy",1

"Cancel culture is officially nearing the end, if you were still on the woke bandwagon get a life, a job dich Facebook and CNN and maybe just maybe you can move out of mommy‘s spare room:   https://youtu.be/gmXTUSP9a9M",0
Also I wanna say if anyone makes a joke about heterosexuality the does that give me the right to burn Netflix to the ground because they’re discriminating??,1
Dave is speaking truth/facts,0
He seems drunk,0
"I am a Muslim man. I worked with a large group of Gay people and Trans. I never treated a person unfairly or disrespected a person for their way of life, and they are people like you and I. However I believe it is ok to disagree. My book (creed/belief/way of life) disagrees with a gay or a trans. Simultaneously, their book disagrees with mine. Heck they must disagree on both accounts. So it goes. My book disagrees with theirs and vice versa. But we shouldn't disrespect the person holding the book for holding whichever book. One should not embrace their book to the point where you become a fanatic or an extremist. After all these are books that have existed before our time. You must be yourself aside of your book. A place that isn't gay, or religious. I expect people to crack jokes on what I believe in. The things I do and do not within applying the book. But we are not our books at the end of the day. After I die people will carry the books. We have to be ourselves and respect one another despite the books. I feel this is a good means of evolving. Disagree and have a chat about it. This too is good.  Dave Chapelle is genuine. He would not disrespect people. You can tell by his honesty and reasoning for the greater good of humanity. He is one that means well. He disagrees. But he is a good person in or outside of his beliefs. Perhaps it's the social inequality of 'still' being African American yet not American in America - as to why Dave addresses trans and their benefits over others. Perhaps its... well I think that may be it haha. Overall Dave is a comedian. A damn good one. I commend him on his reasoning, and the tool that is his legendary humor.   I didn't know who Hannah Gadsby was and wow! I'm watching some of her stuff and she is holding mighty tight to her book. So much so that I dare say that Dave Chapelle would mostlikely save my life if I was racist than Hannah in a life or death situation. Unless I was a girl haha. She just seems like she has a heavy darkness within her. Anywho treat each other good, and ease up ✌🏼",1
Dont back down Dave. Cancel culture has to stop.,0
"Haters gonna hate, and change genders apparently.",1
Included there pronouns 💀,1
"Of course he turned off comments on the clip. He's going to get everything from ""yay way to go"" ... To ""I'm going to kill you"".. from all walks of life... No way to keep up with it all.",0
Trans community won’t talk about their role in Daphnes suicide will they.,1
Omg it’s COMEDY!!! He makes fun of EVERYONE!!!!! If you can’t take a joke that’s on you. Get a sense of humor🤷🏻‍♀️🙄,0
"We need more Trans jokes , lots more. Not less . Thank you Dave 4 being a real man. Never bow . Never take a knee .",1
MEN are MEN WOMAN are WOMAN. God did not make a mistake the mistake is when sin enters into the body of a human being and causes them to depart from sanity thinking they are something that they are not Satan has deceived the whole world unless these things repent they will bust hell wide open I call them things because they are an abomination to GOD's creation a man cannot become a woman and a woman cannot become a man no matter how much they deceive their small brains into thinking so.

Use all that energy ti make All Americans accept one another as Americans regardless of who you are attracted too.",0
You go Dave these confused individuals just want attention,0
WHAT AM I MISSING HERE ❓ It was a Great Special... Are ya all just looking for a fight with him? He DID NOT DISRESPECT ANYONE IT WAS PERFECT SO STOP MAKING TROUBLE 😤 THERE'S ENOUGH OF THAT.,0
Even if it was. He has a rt to what he wants to Say. Just like they have a rt to be gay in Public or continue to push that its ok to be Gay.,1
"His fans think he’s a martyr. In reality, he will get old and lose relevance. They all do.",0
God bless Dave Chappelle !!!  😭,0
all these people saying “why can’t they just let him be himself?” i don’t think being hateful and making jokes about someone’s existence is really being yourself,0
The most offensive part of Dave's special was the picture of George Floyd at the end,0
America has suicided. Our guys are sucking sick and our girls are munching box.,1
They need to stop making transgender pride a world celebration. Are you serious there's so much work to be done elsewhere people wanna celebrate what they do with opposite sex to everyone. Stop shoving down our throats for goodness sake. I'm a heterosexual and proud of it I don't have to tell the world.,1
There's no freedom of speech in America,0
The upset community🙄,0
How you cancel someone who already cancelled you?,0
Can you shut up and play his jokes,0
"Dag man, what happened to freedom of speech? Let that man live. He spoke facts.",0
"""am i canceled or not?"" Damn he know he will never be canceled",0
Cancel culture is getting out of hand. What happened to people just having opinions and not getting cancelled for it. Just respect other peoples opinions,0
"The trans community can say whatever they want but nobody else can, that’s fair! Said nobody ever!",1
He has nothing to apologise for,0
I feel like everyone who's upset with him should actually have a conversation with HIM to understand what he's saying instead of reading things online when everything's taken out of context!,0
"Please don’t let Cancel Culture kill Comedy…..it’s already killing everything else.  Meanwhile, Kanye walking around in White face and nobody saying anything. Lmfaooooo",0
Acceptance from Hollywood isn't a badge of honor. Good move on Dave’s part for keeping his spine.,0
"I've watched The Closer 3 times and I cannot for the life of me see where he is being derogatory or disrespectful of the trans community. I think the special is one of his best, and obviously if the transgender community is upset, they have not watched it or listened to it in its entirety. Comedians make fun of everyone because that's the art form. If ""comedy"" hurts your feelings, then surviving in this brutal world is going to kick your arse.",1
"And they will keep banning who speaks like Dave, the more they show on any network about LGBTQ+ the more people that will support the ""movement"" and change their gender (like if it was possible)",1
Dave Chapelle is 100% spot on correct!,0
"Dave is the funniest comedian alive today.  When he makes fun of my group, I think, “Hey! He’s making fun of me!”  But I can’t get mad, because he’s so darned funny.",0
"I don’t think Dave said anything wrong. People are so touchy. Okay, let’s take it back to basic science if we have to, genetics is simple. Male or female. Nothing can change that genetic structure regardless of what you want to call yourself. It’s that simple. We respect whatever you want to call yourself, but if you take it back to science basics, there’s your answer.",1
HE SAID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING OFFENSIVE ABOUT TRANS PEOPLE..DID YOU PEOPLE EVEN WATCH IT ?OR YOU JUST WANT SOMETHING TO BITCH ABOUT.?.DID YOU MISS THE PART WHERE HIS TRANS FRIEND KILLED HERSELF BECAUSE SHE WAS BULLIED BY HER OWN TRANS  COMMUNITY !?!?!?!?!? FOH!,1
"LGBT backer here. Dave Chappelle seems more open and honest about these issues than any corporate puppet. I'd have a drink with him anyday. You ""woke"" people need to step out of your goddamn echo-chambers.",0
If they meet with him he will expose the true engine behind this situation. They will never give that a chance. Idk how they will dodge but they will,0
"Yes community, you have to understand we will not vend..., accept, tolerate but never bending!",0
Why did the trans community didn't apologize to one of their own when she committed suicide after being bullied by the same community? That is my question 🙋🏼‍♀️  Dave said you killed my friend and I am going to poke fun of you. You don't listen. Stop trying to make news and ratings from Dave. Is getting old!,1
"I'm team Chapelle, team T.E.R.F and team Let's Go Brandon.",1
"I still have heard the jokes, I'm not buying Netflix",0
"Here's one, could Dave address the fact all his friends and politicians are raping and murdering children? Oh wait, that's not manufactured outrage. Wake up people.",0
man why do the lgbt community get offended so much.,1
Dave Chapelle doesn't know how to read? I guess not. Can I also make fun of him or am I not allowed to make fun of rich celebrities who can't read? Who's the snowflake now? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender_history,0
"Damn, Hollywood has really fucked Arsenals head up to hell and back.",0
He's very smart all hes doing is pushing that line you dont cross . to stir his career. Keep his name out there. Some ppl stand on others to keep from sinking.. And the girl he named the show after killed herself.. I always thought comedians were supposed to make you laugh. Reminds me of late night shows . celebrities talking politics. Ppl are getting their platforms mixed up.,0
If it was war Us vs them  They wouldn’t even be here anymore,0
He knows that it's all because of the government and industries!  They've been taking it the wrong way trying to force stuff down our throats.,0
"Mr. Cappelle, God bless you,  no you're not canceled,  they crazy  will be. Keep  moving forward.  God bless America 🇺🇸",0
The alphabet ppl hating are 🤡🤡,1
"Dave Chappelle is hands-down the best comedian there has ever been. I'd personally really enjoy taking a bat to every person that is a part of or supports the cancel culture concept...so over these people. Get a life all you overprotected, whiney betches.",0
“ Dave Chapelle speaks out and he’s not backing down”. Good.,0
Trans people aren't real,1
People are stupid,0
#SaveChappelle,0
"He didn't ""make derogatory comments about gender."" And so-called Terf is not ""an ideology that excludes trans women"".   Typically lazy, sloppy McCarthyist soundbites masquerading as journalism.",1
"I never thought I would say this but Dave Chappelle has shown us the way to stand up to cancel culture. Stand your ground, never apologize and don't give a f**k with how upset they get.",0
So what do they want? He's apology. This is probably nothing today with gay people. I think it's the government of s***,1
"All you loonie tunes can dress up all you want ,you can play my little pony, you can play like what ever you like to play, notice play is key ! When you get home to bathe look at yourself in the mirror if that's a penis guess what, if it's a vagina guess what and your either one or the other nothing in between , fact is there's only 2 to choose from all other choices are bull crap !!",1
"As soon as he said those two words ""my God "" that explained everything.",0
Hannah Gadsby is NOT funny! Lol,0
"My goodness, what a blurring of the lines psychologically messed up .03% of the country Such hypersensitive crybabies.",0
HE IS A COMEDIAN!!! WHY DO PEOPLE TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY???,0
Transgender folks can't take a joke!!,1
Please stop he did nothing to no body. Everyone is looking for this poor man down fall. Am happy he turned off comments like he should.,0
"They are doing too much, if you want inclusion so bad you have to go through the same thing everybody else go through including jokes",0
Dave based af,0
God made a man and woman to be just that who they are read in the Bible what it says about them and where they are going if they don't change.,1
DAVE is FUnny!!!!! LOL,0
How many people where at the walk out? Why a close up shot?,0
Really? They can take a huge d*ck but they can’t take a joke. Nonsense.,1
Gender confusion shouldn't be tolerated!,1
It's so crazy that anyone in the LGBT community believes that they are so high and mighty that they are beyond being  joked about? Screw that! Everyone and everything  is up for grabs when it comes to comedy! No one is too high that they can't be joked about!,1
he wants a slap from WILL SMITH,0
Is Netflix hiring,0
I'm with Dave 100%,0
im on dave chapelles side,0
"Dave is a comedian whose job is to be funny. If people don’t think he’s funny, they shouldn’t listen to him.",0
U gay niggas just sad,1
Don't apologize. He's famous enough. Made enough. Has many fans... They support him. I support him. Delusional People... Pay them no mind 🙄,0
"This tension is ""Hollywood"" trying to come at him because they're in their feelings. Some people can be bought and some people can't. Thank you Mr. Chapelle for being the latter.  If this ""cancel culture"" continues, we're going wake up without our FIRST AMENDMENT rights.  🚨🚨🚨🤫🤐🚨🚨🚨",0
Lgbt liberstion lol,1
"I do not blame dave. If people don't understand dave, They don't understand what it means to be a comedian. Let dave show up to your job and tell you how to do things at the office, See how offended you are then. It's the mans job to make us laugh. If it's at the expense of others, Who cares, You don't hear me complaining when white people get called out for everything. I laugh!!! It's comedy, Don't like it? Talk to a therapist cause obviously you have deep seeded issues that don't involve dave...",0
Love David Chapelle and all his stand up I laughed out loud and at the same time I was uncomfortable  He is brilliant,0
People who are upset about people making jokes must have a really cushy life.,0
“..LBGTQ community”,1
Dave Chappelle is awesome,0
"🗣 He didn’t do anything wrong, if he can walk away from 50 million dollars for his morals .. he ain’t backing down because a group of people don’t like him 🤷🏽‍♀️",0
Life is art. Trans create themselves into what they desire to be. Which is no different than than anyone who desire to gravitate to what they want to be. To outlaw the comedian community isn't it fair to outlaw the trans community?  All communities  are accepted in America.,1
Equality means you get to be shit on by comedians just like everyone else.,0
lol ET you uhh.. gunna mention of how Dave’s trans friend Daphne killed herself after the lgbtq+%@$!()]ñ cyberbullied her for expressing her thoughts about his special?    I’ll wait….,0
Why is he saying these hateful jokes anyway? Like who cares? If a white dude came on stage and started making 'jokes' about different ethnicities you'd damn well be right there'd be outrage...why do people expect anything different? When you have to pretend hate speech is 'jokes' you've already lost.,0
"He’s made jokes about every group under the sun you could imagine, and this is where the line is drawn?  He’s a comedian, not your kid’s elementary school teacher.  This is HIS JOB",0
"@entertainmenttonight He did not make derogatory comments, that was a blatant and press worthy lie. Watch the actual special. He went after EVERYONE as he always does, lol.",0
They are so DAMN Sensitive I said what I said!!!,0
Dave Chapele Rules. Cancel culture F*** YOU,0
"Kevin Sorbo said, ""Being offended means you can't control your own emotions.  Grow up.""  I agree.  SOME of the Alphabet people are the most easily-offended, closed-minded group alive.  You go, Dave!!! KEEP THE HUMOR ALIVE!!!",0
"I bet he won't make a joke about black lives matter 🤣 Because jokes are HALF MEANT, that is why it's FUNNY. If you're saying it because it's funny, means you're also saying it because it is half-meant. I guess it is time to move on from Netflix 😏",0
"We the straight people who have moral values are being discriminated against. Everything we once were taught is morally bad, are now being taught its right. We are living in a upside-down world Everything is now backwards.",1
"It’s stupid to cancel a comedian, if it’s not to your taste don’t listen to that comedian. I’m not out here canceling heavy metal music, i just don’t listen ro it and let that group of people do their thing",0
"Well, if what he says here is offensive to certain people they need to wise-up. The more complaints about isms and for phobias for the minutest of  things the more the  REAL thing is diluted.",0
I was confused about why dave got so much hate so i had some of my gay and trans friend watch with me and explain how it might be too much for oversensitive people but it was alright for them. It wasnt anything that would really affect them but the others just had to make a big fuss and walk out.,1
I'm with Dave 👍,0
"why is race, gender, orientation... even discussed at the work-place. It has no business in any conversation there. Shut up, stop gossiping, and do your jobs.",0

"I don't give a fk IF Dave was disrespectful, just like trans people don't give a fk when he uses the n-word. The selective ""outrage"" is nauseating. Keep stomping Dave!✊✊!",1
Don't nobody got to pretend a person is a certain gender and they know they're not you pretend I'm not pretending,1
"I also have to add that Tosh.O has said some of the most disrespectful, disgusting, racist, sexiest, vilest things I've ever heard. But he's HILARIOUS. Why are there no human subgroups going after him? 🤨🤔  Tosh, like Chapelle, is an equal opportunity offender.  In my opinion, the best comedy offends you, makes you think and laugh all at the same time.",0

We’ve forgotten to laugh at ourselves..   Laughter is a wonderful coping mechanism. I’ve seen my favorite comics go to $hit because they’re afraid of offending someone and being cancelled.   Props to him for standing his ground.  Today’s peeps really couldn’t handle the comics of the 80’s 🤣🤣  And if you don’t like it, F  CK YOUR COUCH!!!!",0
"Entertainment Tonight !!!!! you all ought to be ashamed of yourselves, you are trying to lean towards the transgender community,  and slight Dave chappelle , the fact of the matter is this, gender is a fact!!!!!!!!

I’m pretty sure most of the people on these comments don’t understand what TERF stands for and what the people who accept that title believe about trans people.   If you’re transphobic this is the best place to out yourself; behind a screen with a faceless profile picture. You’ll have plenty of supporters. But just remember your digital footprint.,0
Trevor Noah said it best….,0
Bruh i know trans people and theyre not mad is the worst excuse ever. Saying your a terf and then saying your an ally is not compatible at all.,0

I to am all for free speech,but when it comes from willful ignorance and spread like it's the truth,and some people will take it as such. Then you personally are responsible for the consequences of your actions. It didn't help his case one bit when he said go terfs in a meaningful way.",0
Why is it they are the victims when they go around and blacklist people all the time. You can get fired for upsetting them.,0
I knew America was in trouble when Ethan Klein (H3H3) started a podcast with Hassan and started trying to cancel people even though he has said and done TONS of shit that would get any main stream entertainer canceled. Reminds me of that speech at the end of the third Star Wars prequel. He went from saying the N word with idubbbz to having a left leaning politically correct podcast.. it seems like if you want to be popular this day in age in any form of entertainment you need to sell your soul and be a fraudulent douche that panders to the softies on the internet. Oh and I’m not political at all. It’s just obnoxious. I miss the old YouTube.,0
Very easy from Chapelle to laugh with a community who has it already hard,0
They/He/him what is the purpose of that if you know their name?,1

Chapelle is the GOAT and he wont be canceled!,0
"Anyone ever wonder if these far left woke maniacs are just demons wearing human skin? They say they fight racism, yet they are the racists. They fight sexism, yet they are sexist.  They can’t have a debate, they just start yelling and cussing and name calling. They talk about saving Democracy yet they want to eliminate and silence any opposition to their rule (you know, like facism) They constantly wish death upon people they don’t agree with. There hasn’t been a more clear division between good and evil since Hitler walked the earth.",0

Car comedians have been talking about women getting raped and murdered women particularly black how loud we are how rude we are her irrational we are it's not a crime really to rape a black child or black woman there's no hard prison times I have a hard I have a hard time feeling sorry for them the transgender black women because there's still no justice for regular black women I mean to me we're all the same when it comes to Justice there's no justice,0
"All these LG B2 plus people talk about equality and liberation and it all sounds good but in reality all they want is more meat options. they want the whole world to accept them and their style of living just to get in their pants..... and that is the truth,  mic drop!",1
"just to be clear, no LGBTQ individual enjoys laughing at themselves more than we do.  I think that this reality has become lost on this discussion.  However, the fact remains that Dave more often than not equates gay white entitlement.  n his monologues for many years now, rater than help us feel included in the joke, Dave makes it really clear that we are the joke. I get it that people of color, especially comedians,  feel that they should get a pass to express their views but these are days of reckoning and black heterosexuals are no exceptions.  You too have done some terrible things with regards to the LGBTQ community!  To be honest you were at least a decade behind the rest of the world in treating us like human beings.  This is why we are so pissed off right now.",0

"This is absolutely BS, what happened to freedom of speech, why are only some people allowed that right when it is everyone's God given right.

This is all the media's fault (all types of media) because they know controversy means ratings.",0
Misinformation to the fullest extent,0
Why everybody made it's just a joke right 🤣🤣,0
Love me some Chappelle:),0
Why isbit always america that always starts this sort of bullshit.,0
lgbt are the same as those crazy evangelicals from the 90s always outraged by something,1
"Are you going to cut out the parts where he talked about Jewish ppl and put that into a clip? Or the parts about black people or women? Stop trying to create problems for the sake of it, people have a right to an opinion. We are going to end up fascist. As a black woman who has been through a lot based on my gender, race and nationality (when you reside in a country that isn't your birthday place) I think certain members of society are using their position to bully others and not allow healthy but hard human discussions. Being trans doesn't mean you loose any self-entitled constructs you may have had before your transition. Women and transwomen should not be at war, but to deny someone's 'human experience' will result in exactly that. It's provoking to deny sis women their rights to claim their womenhood since its from birth and a hell of an experience/journey. It's also crass to deny someone's experience as a trans person since clearly they are having a ""human experience"" (which is what David said in his show). A trans woman does not have the same experience as a sis woman, what's wrong with saying that out loud, that we are not the same, but it's OK we are all having human experiences!",0
I'm trans and his jokes were funny as fuck? What? IT WAS A JOKE bruh LMFAOOO,0
The irony of the alphabet people not listening….,1
he is irresponsible.  dangerous,0
I haven't seen any access exactly what he's saying and explained point by point why they believe he's wrong. I'd love to hear a good faith dialogue about what he said bc Dave raised some very interesting ideas that can't easily be shrugged off in the name of being an ally,0
The press lies we've seen it proven time and time again.  Any little thing they can take out of context they can and will.  99% Pathetic group of losers in that industry and they all know it.,0
You cut out his best of the  conditions to the Netflix employees.,0
"By Ashlee Marie Preston's standard He/She/They should cancel him/her/themself. He/She/They tweeted some of the most racist comments against Asians and Mexicans, threatened to bash someone's head in with a can and made homophobic comments.  #cancelashleemariepreston #irony",0
"Listen folks, as recently as the late 90's you could still talk shit about who ever the fuck you wanted as a joke and it was understood by nearly everyone that it was funny. Not only that but you could joke around in a brazenly offensive manner and people would think practically universally that it was hilarious.   It's not that 90% of the people in the US don't remember this. It's that all forms of media are being used to control people and get them to stop doing this, and 90% of people are just going along with what TV makes them think they are supposed to do without really questioning it, because they are non-confrontational and not deeply introspective. They just go along with society or at least the picture of what society is that gets painted on media. If they talked to more people in person at length about these things they would probably find that they have a really hard time finding anyone that actually agrees with any of this crap.  Essentially the TV and other media is being used to display a fake picture of society. One where these ideas are accepted fact. Since most people are just clicky types of non-confrontational people that go along with society, it works, and you can control a huge population of people very easily like that. That's all it is. It's really that simple people. The media is being used to brainwash people, and it's working really really well.  So well that you can tell people over and over again that it's happening and they still don't believe it.",0

Omg get over it go to ur safe place you they him her them what or whatever  grow a pair or lose a pair either way I don't  care  just mind ur business I will mind mine. Dave Chappell  is hilarious  period...,1
"People are to serious,",0
"I’m part of the trans community.  I’ve loved Chappelle since the 90’s.   Dude is hilarious.  I can’t even get worked up about any of this, he’s just too damn funny!  I don’t believe he has any malice toward the trans community at all.  I think he’s one of the greats of comedy, and he’s still one of my favorite comics of all time.",0
Freedom of speech!! That’s all I gotta say about all this and all comedy specials,0
How do you expect to succeed in life if a joke ruins your day?,0
Dave contributed more to comedy and society than any alphabet soup whiner ever did. Change my mind.,1
I also was a man trapped into a woman's body...     For 9 months,1
Dave Chapelle is a national treasure not just a comedian but the storyteller Of the age.  Fearless and  unafraid to say what needs to be said to bridge divides and start conversations.  The real culprits here is the media that is stirring up division among people for profit,0
Dave makes fun of EVERYONE. What the fuck gives the LGBTQ-5.0 the right to think they are above everyone else that they can't be made fun of?,1
Jokes Are FUNNY!!!,0
I’m still buying Dave’s ticket period.,0
"1. Satire/Comedy has no limits, just because you're offended doesn't mean that you're right. 2. You don't get to decide what people can say or believe, if that hurts your feelings then stay in your echo chamber/safe space. 3. Stop being sheep and learn to think for yourself, the Media hasnt been honest for close to a decade now...they all have an agenda and will only give you the truth or parts of it if it forwards their narrative/agenda.  To anyone who has a problem with anything I just said, good luck finding someone who gives a f*ck cause I sure as hell don't.",0

Since when did people now attack on freedom of speech,0
It wasnt Controversial Stop Shillin for the ABC Community,1

#GenderIsAFact,1
People don't be fooled look at the like too dislike ratios and the small crowd at Netflix was a joke.,0
When people can't control their emotions they try to change the behaviour of others,0
"Dave is such a weirdo for this.   The trans advocates said they reached out to him privately but he declined.   Obviously we don't have proof of that, but who gets a private invitation from someone, ignores it, then goes on stage and passive agressively rants about the invite and tries to demonize the person that invited them as some kind of tyrant?   Dave Chappelle is a grown man.   He's acting like an attention starved alt right teenager right now, doubling down on dangerous and edgy rhetoric, and having more fun saying ""eff you I won't do what you tell me"" than creating actual content or creating content of any quality (aka does anyone care that Dave is hardly even funny or exceptional insightful about anything anymore? Doesn't seem like it).    Let his goofy ass run around and play a cancel culture battle of his own imagination, for him and his fans to scream ""victory"" and ""destroyed!"" like they like to do any time they gain an inch with their dumbass bigotry and remedial observations, or whenever they ""get away with"" saying something dangerous or dumb.",0
"Sure, ""cancel"" him and see where that gets you solving the real issues that exist for lgbt in the world. Dave isn't shacked up with any big corporation right now and he's always going to sell out stadiums no matter what. This is a stalemate, there's nothing you can do about this really except sit down and talk to the man and understand him and that he is a man good at heart",0
"they work at netflix for crying out loud. its hard to feel bad for them a few years ago he was funny, now everyones crying. get a furking life!",0
Don’t apologize. Fuck cancel culture.,0
HE DID NOT SAY HE IDENTIFIED AS TURF. HE 👏WAS 👏BEING 👏SARCASTIC👏,0
LOVE YOU CHAPPELLE LOVE YOU,0
So true… always the corporate interest,0
He has no right to even talk about trans people! He doesn't understand what it's like to be trans and needs to realise that picking fault with or joking about trans people is not okay! He needs to learn his place. Cancel him! Then he will learn! TRANS POWER!,0
"im transgender and i was never bothered by dave Chapelle, he’s actually one of my favorite comedians!! And seeing all these extreme lgbtq advocates exaggerate and try to cancel anyone makes me feel so ashamed to be classified with them. I’m against cancel culture, but since they are out there making a fool of themselves. It reflects badly on the rest like me. I hate being in the community with those people. I hope people don’t generalize me with them :c",0
Why is the trans community the only community you are not aloud to joke about?,0
Trans Lives Matter,0
Boohoo,0
There is no controversy. A handful of people who want to play the victim card and crave media attention are saying this is offensive.,0
"He has my support, just as much as the trans community has my support. I don't like dave because he polks fun at the Trans community, i like Dave because he polks at EVERYONE! He doesn't discriminate.",0
I'm becoming more and more convinced that it's the controlling elite pushing this controversy. It's interesting to me that the majority of comments online that I have read are in favor of Chapelle. So who did he really offend? My guess is those whose 50mil he turned down...🤔,0
Love Dave,0
Dave Chappelle is the 🐐,0

Hollyweird is demented. Their time is soon up.,0
I'm just now watching the special. They made such a big deal that I had to click on it.. sorry,0
"I will always love Dave Chappelle; he's insanely funny. Not sure what jokes he said and I'm looking around utube for them now. but I'd bet he was funny as heck. Not sure why people or anyone else thinks they're bullet proof from a comedian. No one is, and no one should be. it's just how it is, they tag everybody, everywhere, doesn't matter what race, color, creed, etc. a good comedian especially a really funny one, clowns da shyt, out of everyone. Open season.",0

The man was not up on stage saying “attack the trans/lgbtq community”  He’s using his freedom of speech for good not evil/hate….,0
These trans folk sure get a lot of unnecessary coddling,1
I mean Chappelle literally warned the audience that the funniest things to say are usually the meanest and I mean is he wrong?¿?¿,0
One word: OPPORTUNITISTS !!,0
🤔 Yeah Dave,0
Team chappelle forever,0
I looked at the Closer and I don't know what the fuss is all about. Looks like he was making a bigger point about feminism an who cintrols the narrative.,0
The LG HDTV community is getting a little out of hand.,1
fucking derogatory comments no he made jokes there’s a condifference,0
Why so offended 🤣,0
If he making crack jokes it's all fun and games ! Transgender jokes he gone to far . He say crack baby selling crack Hahaha. It's comedy .. Freedom of speech yeah ok. 2021.,1
If you saw the trans racist that works at netflix n their tweets. U would clap your hands for what Dave said. Some people just dont deserve to have a voice no matter what.,1
twatter is not a real place 🤣,0
"glad to see truth is picking up steam, thank God people are brave enough to speak out. Do not be silenced and do not be cancelled. I don't remember who said this ""They can only cancel you, if you let them."" DO not apologize",0
Why do so many cis people have an opinion about this? What do they know?,0
The alphabet community are more against the LAWS OF GOD than they are against Dave Chapelle.,1

who care what yall gays ppl say..... the truth does always hurt smh...,1
Dave actually was trying  to be more inclusive than divisive if someone was to actually watch the Closer from beginning to end. Dave deserves an apology from everyone who did not actually listen to what he was saying in the special. He should be welcomed everywhere by everyone...,0
"We won't let them cancel him... Idk how many times we have to tell people, Dave isn't going anywhere!!!",0
"Dave's intent does not matter. He's wrong on the subjects he's trying to speak on, and he's trying to desensitize and radicalize people in thinking dehumanization is acceptable and harmless.    He can make whatever jokes he wants, but he does not get to control the narrative of what he's coming across like and what he's contributing to.   He's coming across like a dumb edgy alt right incel, and he's contributing to real world harm and miseducation of people.    Y'all cape for deplorable and inaccurate points if you want, but he's looking and acting so embarrassing and gross for someone of his age and intellect and status right now.",0
Trans ppl honestly jus make me laugh 😂,1
"Dave has made jokes about every race, gender, etc etc… wtf is going on. He’s a comedian! A comedian! A comedian tells jokes.. this is laughable",0
Love Chapelle! Good to see a black man recruiting for the far right white supremacists! So cool! (Sarcasm),0
This comment section and the reaction to the special proves people don’t care about trans people.,0
Take Chappelle’s statements but show Andrew Dice Clay and you will see the flaw of his “thinking’,0
The sheer ego of these people that think they cannot be made fun of!,0
"""Chapelle turned off comments on the clip"", it's quite ironic that you turned off your dislikes on this video....",0
"Basically individuals on Twitter claim to speak for a whole community, while making it about themselves. And they didn't even watch his Netflix specials. Or perhaps rather they heard Dave is doing transphobic standup comedy so they blocked out everything in the material and delivery that wasn't about the LGBT community.",1
"ET, framing your story with a bias against Mr. Chappelle.",0
He’s a great guy. 💕,0
"I watched it, and I don't get all the hoopla. If Netflix cancels Dave, I'm canceling Netflix. Facts.",0
"Chapelle is like that old racist grandpa everybody has. ""Oh granddad. Your awful but you'll be dead soon.""",0
The “T”ssss are pissing off,1
ABSOLUTE LEGEND!,0
i thought america was the free world,0
Dave literally said “I don’t know why people are calling me bigoted towards the LGBT community. I have friends who are trans” 🙄,0
"Either people have forgotten how to laugh or they're too scared to laugh. And for the most part, the ones being so critical of Mr. Chappelle are the ones doing all the bullying and everything they're supposed to be against.",0
"Trans people : “feel free to joke about absolutely every one else’s life choices, just not ours”.Seems fair",1
"I really don't see what the fuss is about either. The LGBTQ community wants equality and to be treated like everyone else???? Then LEARN TO TAKE A F$#@%IN JOKE! That's being treated like everyone else. . . because Dave makes fun of blacks, whites, latinos, asians, middle eastern, straight, gays, good people, bad people, rapists, actors, musicians, comedians, drug addicts and everything else in between. That's EQUALITY. Give me a break",1
Brilliant 😂,0
"Get over yourselves, freakshows.",0
"I BET THE PEOPLE THAT PUT THE THUMBS DOWN , HAVE NOT EVEN WATCHED THE SPECIAL . TIPICAL OF SOME PEOPLE TO  JUST USE HEARS and follow like sheep.",0
Chappelle ALWAYS speaks the truth. And they dont like it,0
"Don’t blame the alphabet. Look at archie bunker, carrol O’Connor wasn’t racist, he was sharing the views of society",1
Good for Dave 💯 support to Dave,0
"Freedom if speech people!. It's called opinions and we all have them. We should not have this backlash or cancel culture bullshit because of ones opinions.  It may not be polite but it isn't a crime to hurt someone's feelings either, so anyone butt hurt over someone's opinions should maybe stay in their house or wear earplugs outdoors and not be on social media!. PERIOD!. DONT LIKE IT, I HONESTLY DONT CARE!",0
People like you Dave who stand their ground and don't give in to the snow flakes earn much respect. Give em hell,0
this is what comedy is no boundrys so the trans comunity can deal with it,1

"He's the Majik Johnson, of CV. That was hella funny.",0
People get so fucking butt-hurt too fucking easily now a days. It's so stupid.,0
But why does Netflix show trans relationship not everyone is intrested in knowing that.. but they forcefully put in every show and movie.. could be a reason for there fall 😆,1
That community tries having a grip over EVERYTHING we all get clowned on get used to it you’re human like the rest of us. It’s called freedom of speech,0
"I'm trans and I found nothing wrong with his jokes.   (That being said, the people in the comments using this situation as an excuse to be blatantly transphobic are the farthest thing from good people or from Chappelle's character).",0
I stand by Dave Chappelle.  The people that want to shut down freedom of speech are double standards.,0
"I love Dave Chappelle but saying you had a trans freind when being called transphobic is the equivalent of saying ""I have a black friend"" when called racist",0
The work they do is based on their personal knowledge level! It’s not related to sex!,0
"The same guy who complains about people not being civil with each other and not listening to each other refuses to be civil and listen. I'm sorry, but he's refusing to understand WHY what he said was not okay and refuses to acknowledge the mistake. Then worse, he cries about people being upset with him because the type of humor he uses is no longer humor that works in this day and age. That's like in the older days of people constantly doing racist jokes against specific ethnicities crying because those jokes are now considered offensive and continue to push stereotypes that were never okay to begin with. Sorry, but people (even comedians) need to realize that consequences are a thing and if it means losing their job because they've pissed off enough people, that's on them.",0
This is hilarious!!!!,0
Dave has always been a stand up guy and really encompasses freedom of speech!,0
IF WITH DAVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 100%,0

"Sense of humor is what we need,",0
"What I love about these videos is that the people accusing Dave Chappelle of attacking the trans community cannot recite a single phrase that Dave uses that attacks trans people, do you know why? Because Dave Chapelle has never attacked trans people and they cannot prove that he ever dead",0
People nowadays are too sensitive to accept the truth.,0
Get a sense of humor.  If we can't laugh at ourselves we're all screwed.  Dave is a good guy who tells jokes.,0

This is the glorious privilege of his faithful ones. Praise the LORD!",0
"I think it’s so awesome these two can live, happily, embodying their identities and without the drastic surgeries that so many trans people have to undergo.

6:45 people shouldn’t have to do significant work or anything to gain respect. Respect should always be mutually present no matter what circumstances. We’re literally people before anything else so we shouldn’t act like we’re better than we are when we’re all the same.,0
" I mean exactly what you have described. If transgenderism is a subject to be taught in schools, it would fall under the ""social sciences"" not hard sciences.  Gender ideologues wish it taught in biology class because they need to eradicate inconvenient truths like human beings, like all mammals, are sexually dimorphic. In doing so, they deny the validity of empiricism, the very basis of science itself.",1
"Honestly , she shouldn’t treat him like that . And yes I said him because , in my opinion you’re born a specific gender. You live that part of your life being that gender and then switch in teen years . He is confused , he doesn’t understand that.

"It's kind of a phony issue though. Transgender people don't ever claim that being a transwoman is the same as being a biological woman.

He said that, in every part of logic, it is pointless to need to know why something exists in order to make legal decisions about it, when that affects human rights, and explained that instead there should be a lot of research about it but for different reasons, aka science reasons only versus moral reasons, because that isn't what science is about.",0
" I'm born gay, I was born again as an ex-evangelical who then realized how the religion of homophobes is completely fake, perverted and corrupted to be of hatred and hypocrisies. The religion of homophobes is only about the ""sin"" of homosexuality, other than that all hetero sexual immoralities are celebrated, which is why all hetero sinners are allowed to get unlimited number of marriages regardless of how many more divorces or sins they continue to commit, just like Kim Davis among many other conservative ""Christians"".",0
 someone didn't brush up his advanced biology  Trans people have been a thing for centuries and in any serious scientific field they're considered to be a very valid thing. You're fighting shadows on the wall rn.  Scientifically speaking someone born in the body of a man can then transition into a woman with social and hormonal therapy because gender≠sex but now we're getting into slightly advanced biology.,0
"A man is a man since he was created by God as a man, a woman is a woman since she was created by God as a woman, the problem of these people is in their head and their education. We are present in this time and we exist because the society respected that the man is a man and the woman is a woman and the man married with woman to have children, it is God who taught us since the creation of Adam and Eve.",1
" Gender and biological sex are inseparable. For me gender is the experience of living in the body of a man or woman. In the case of men, living in a male body means, among many other things, dealing with the shame of unwanted erections that every boy has experienced at some point or another in their life. In the case of women, it means living in the body of a woman, fear violence, associating sex with reproduction, and also menstruation. If I decided that ""I am a woman"" I would be a fake woman because I have no idea of what experience is about. One cannot undone lived experiences so no trans woman can be a woman or trans man a man.   You say that nobody says that sex and gender are separate. But saying ""I am a woman trapped in the body of a man"" implies separateness. I can say ""I'm trapped in a cave"" because me and the cave are two separate entities, but I couldn't say ""my stomach is trapped in my body"" because they are all one entity. And that is the case of gender and sex.  It makes no sense that having trouble accepting their body means that they are the other gender. All it means that they have trouble accepting their body. If I were a short guy and had trouble accepting it, am I now tall?  Lots of mistakes were made with the issue of homosexuality and one of them was suggesting therapy for gay people so they would ""change"". All it took was to realize that it was purely a moral issue of accepting same-sex intimacy as valid, especially male same-sex intimacy. Women's same-sex intimacy has always been socially accepted. I believe that same-sex intimacy has been self-censored by boys and men because of the possibility of an erection, something women don't have to worry about.   But just because ""gay people"" were wrongly forced into therapy does not mean that people who have trouble with accepting their biological sex don't need therapy. There is the possibility that some boys want to be girls because they fear the shame of their erection and it bothers them. If you don't believe me, read ""The Sissy Boy Syndrome"" by Richard Greene. If I'm short and have trouble with me being short, I would consult a therapist to help me accept my body.   What I find strange is that ""conversion therapies"" for sexual orientation are illegal in some countries, yet ""conversion therapies"" (i.e., transitioning) for gender and celebrated. I find it strange that sexual orientation, with no known biological roots, is fixed for life, yet gender, with powerful biological markers, can be changed at will. If people can say ""Today I feel like a woman"", why can't we say ""Today I feel gay but yesterday I was straight"". Bisexuality then doesn't make sense.   There are so many anomalies in the gender and sex studies that for philosophers of science like Thomas Kuhn means that the current paradigm is wrong.",1
"Define gender first. Then ask the question: “What is the essence of being a man or a woman?” Finally, if hypothetically Shapiro’s child turned out to be transgender, would he accept and support the child or continue degrading transgenderism?",0
"In the rest of the world perhaps but not in America.  Gays have the same rights as a straight person does. Perhaps you should put your activism efforts should go towards gay rights abroad, not here in the states.

Marriage as an institution has always been defined as a holy covenant between man and woman and no politicians should be able to undo thousands of years of history and precedent for a political agenda.",1

"Tyson isn't saying that if something exists, it should be taught.

I really don't agree with this bullshit.....

"I do not agree with the part of the video in which you describe to tolerate the intolerable (in this case, the LGBTQ+ community tolerating its opposers). There's a very famous book called “The Open Societies and Its Enemies” by philosopher Karl Popper which details that the tolerance of intolerance will only lead to the death of tolerance.  ""Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. [...] if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them.""  ""[...] We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant. We should claim that any movement preaching intolerance places itself outside the law, and we should consider incitement to intolerance and persecution as criminal, in the same way as we should consider incitement to murder, or to kidnapping, or to the revival of the slave trade, as criminal.""  In other words, if a call for limitless tolerance implies that we must accept the most abhorrent beliefs and behaviours that exist in society (particularly, those that oppress others), we are implicitly endorsing those practices.  So, no. We do not tolerate the intolerable.",0

" Don't worry buddy, i've seen this exact comment thousands times over, since that's the only argument you people have.

"People, especially impressionable children, with Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) aka body dysmorphia or gender dysphoria should not have their dysphoria automatically affirmed and promoted. The majority of the time the dysphoria is a manifestation of other deep rooted issues. These people have incredibly low self esteem, often many comorbid mental issues, and no true sense of self or future. If all root issues are solved and the gender dysphoria still exists then it is legitimate. This should take years of therapy properly deconstructing the base causes - certainly not 1 or 2 visits.   There are many places where children are able to see gender therapists without parental consent. These therapists can prescribe hormone therapy on the first visit also without parental consent. The child patients do not have the cognitive ability to understand the consequences of many things and why age of majority is 18.   I will never agree with chemical castration of children, double mastectomy in children, bottom surgery in ftm trans children that majority of the time has medical complications, homone therapy/ blockers for children   that have not been tested and studied with this type of use.

Young people are finding out who they are, and in the process, they may change their minds about their identity. Your job as a parent or as an older role model is to support them in their changes so that they feel comfortable with who they are. This is why self esteem amongst teenagers and young adults is so low; we as a society don't accept them for being who they are.",0

"The scientific question is: What does it mean to identify as a bug and what is the explanation for it? Sexual identity is not like your belief that you are a bug.

"Here’s the thing. Jesus instructs His followers to not be afraid of holding each other accountable of our sins and trespasses. In other words, we shouldn’t be afraid of correcting one another when we are falling short in terms of our relationship with God by sinning. So, correcting someone who is in the wrong is not the same as deflecting your problems by putting other people on blast. There are many Christians who do that, but I am not one of those Christians.  And another thing. The Bible mentions marriage several times, but the only form of marriage that God has ever shown approval of, is the marriage between a man and a woman. “A man shall leave his father and mother, and be joined to his wife.” It doesn’t say a man a shall be joined to his husband, it doesn’t say a woman shall be joined to her wife, it says a man shall be joined to his wife. Any other form of marriage is abominable in God’s eyes. So how could I call myself a Christian if I show blatant approval towards sin? The people who claim to be “Devoted Christians”, yet consistently disrespect God by twisting His Word to support their own agendas, are not just liars, they are hypocrites as well.

You cannot force anyone to call you a woman if you are male and you cannot force people to call you a man if you were born a female.

"Neil deGrasse Tyson's point of view has fundamental flaws which can be fleshed out rather easily. His point that no study about any subject should ever result in any legislation that restricts freedoms of any individual at any time regardless of the outcome of the study. That would have to include the right of an individual who has a known genetic abnormality that would be passed on to children, be it physical or mental, be allowed to breed free from any consequence of the outcome of that coupling, that could impart an economic duty onto the rest of society, who had no choice in the free decision of said choices by those who made them. So that being said, you could equate pure freedom to anarchy. Or follow pure democracy to the end which would result in the demise of the society. It is why no society in the known history of the human race has ever had a form of government that followed pure democracy that was successful. It's own demise is built into the very theory. I would then say that unfettered freedom is also unsustainable based on those very concepts. Legislation to curb absolute freedom will occur or the society will doom itself.",0

Prince Harry is not educated nor smart with seriously bad taste to have made such a poor choice of a wife. Not to mention he betrayed his own family and country for woke hollywood? Absolutely treasonous! (I wonder if Harry even comprehend fully what Meghan is going on and on about)",0

Lol. That is not how humans work. You are talking about less than 1% of cases where people regret their surgery, and most often not because they got their understanding of their identity wrong but because they may have preferred to keep living with what they were used to for years.

"Neil, brilliant astrophysicist, not a biologist or sport scientist - the advantage that males have over females in sport come from more than just hormones/testosterone ( male puberty = greater growth and different skeleton, more muscle development and distribution).

The misuse of science and freedoms, is worth thinking about. Interestingly, the use of laws to limit free speech are coming about because of gender ideology activists rather than conservatives.",1

"I know that some people think that by pointing out the fact that homosexuality is sin, Christians are being hateful. But the truth is that because as Christians we know that the end of all sin is eternal suffering in hell we are raising awareness to this darkness that is in our society. A lot of people are surrounded by a community of people who support their homosexual lifestyle, but they still experience gender disphoria after going trans. In fact statistics show that 40% of transgender people have committed suicide upon switching genders. This stuff is more than just skin deep. There is more to this than meets the eye. There is serious gender confusion going on and lying to people and making them believe that all this is ok is the worst thing a Christian can ever do.

The answer is that Tyson understands that however interesting the science of sex and sexual identity might be -- the controversy over this issue has nothing to do with science and everything to do with what is perceived as a threat to a cultural and religious worldview.

I must add there is a very similar problem within the community, as a transgender binary woman (meaning I mostly identify with the traditional definition of a woman) I have seen a lot of hate towards binary trans people from nb folks, I understand that by identifying with things outside the binary you would want people to respect that and understand that there's more than that, but these people attack just for being part of said binary stating that the binary should be abolished. Making binary people, trans or not, feel bad about their gender is as problemic as attacking the nb label itself.  I think people should be open to listen to what other's have to say before having an opinion and it saddens me that the loudest part of the LGBTQ community is giving people a reason to dislike us all.",0

The only difference is the sex cells, which were deformed by the condition itself. So it makes no sense if I grew a tumor and had it removed, for you to call me a tumor.

Therefore, you seem to be reading the story from a perspective of the same male dominance that brought this woman in front of Jesus.

"In the 1920s people cigarettes companies launched an advertising campaign where they called cigarettes freedom torches. Freedom from what, perhaps in the eye of a young naive audience it would be the freedom from their oppressive and controlling parents. The irony is that if there is one thing that cigarettes take from you, it’s your freedom. Freedom is an ambiguous term that is often used to associates terrible things with noble ideals, as was the case with the advertisement campaign in the 1920’s. You shouldn't stand up for movement simply because it stands for protecting people freedom, ask yourself the question, freedom from what or to do what. Transgender politics are pushed onto an audience that cannot understand the full implications and consequences associated with becoming transgender. A 5-year-old boy does not understand that when he grows up, he will like women, nor does a 16-year-old understand that when he gets older, he will want a family. Teenagers are not at the level of maturity where they understand the full consequences of their actions, especially regarding sexual decisions. For that reason, it is logical that parents don't want their children exposed to ""educational messages"" that promote transgender politics and ideologies. Statistically speaking, 83% of transgender youth contemplate suicided, and 40% attempt it. A movement that claims altruistic motives because it is about protecting people freedoms can’t seem to rationalize why this is, as a whole it experience cognitive dissonance, thus rather than coming to terms with the obvious conclusion that youth should not be exposed to these messages, they define social pressures and negative media representation as the problem, this way they can hold on to their precious beliefs about protecting peoples freedoms, not realizing they are supporting a movement that fundamentally is destroying the lives of youth. Reproduction is one of the deepest drives we have, it shouldn't come as a surprise to intelligent people that when you strip an individuals ability to have children they fall into a deep depression. Generally speaking, there are two groups of people in society today, those who promote this nonsense, and those who are afraid of the consequences of speaking out against it. Don't be afraid to speak out, be afraid for your children and your children's children.",1

"My issue with your comparison of the lgbtq community and religious people saying ""showing intolerance toward people who are intolerant of you is bad and the lgbtq community are as bad as religious people for doing it."" Is that this just isn't true. In Christian ideology intolerance toward queer people is a fundamental element of their belief it's literally in the Bible. Where as intolerance toward religious people isn't fundamental to being gay or trans nonbinary etc. Being lgbtq isn't even an ideology and you can be queer and religious. The point being you can't just agree to disagree with people who think your very existence is a sin. People in the lgbtq community are so defensive and wary because they're very right to even fucking exist is constantly being challenged. I mean last month a vote to overturn gay marriage almost went through in congress, these people live life on a knifes edge always forced to play defense by communities who simply want them to stop existing. And fundamentally understanding that if they let anti lgbtq ideology run rampant without being challenged it could actually lead to them losing fundamental human rights. All religious people have to do is leave them alone and there will be no problems. These two groups are not equally responsible for poisoning the discourse.",0

Maybe jobs should have equal base pay for man/woman….then performance based pay rewards   It’s a paradox really.  Because people want to be treated like equals yet to achieve the balance one must submit to a lesser power, which ultimately makes them superior.   Makes no sense hiring the lesser.

"I would like to preface this with I am an ally and am also in the furry community and have many many wonderful friends and peers who are in the lgbt community,. But I have had my fair share of bad experiences with people from the lgbt community to the point I actually developed a 'phobia' of certain members of it when I was younger, but I could never talk about it because I would instantly be labelled as homophobic when it wasnt me deciding to be scared of them, but infact trauma which caused me to be scared. So basically when I was younger maybe 12-13 I was sexually assulted by a girl who I thought was a close friend, but she wanted more than that. We used to shower together and swap bras and compare breast sizes etc, sorta just normal close girl friend sorta stuff, which I viewed as totally innocent and fun to be able to share those close things with her, like I did with some of my other best friends. But to find out she was not seeing it as an innocent thing was absolutely terrifying. This has happened more than once, where girls have developed a close friendship with me, promised me that they arent interested in me and its just a friendship have assulted me and tried to convince me to become gay when I have said many many times I am not, but support people who are. I also have been assulted by someone who entered the womans bathrooms pretending to be a trans woman.( I have no issue with trans people using the bathrooms they feel comfortable in). I also was labelled as homophobic for saying no when I was asked out by a girl, and also for saying to my ex that if he transitioned into a girl I could no longer date him as I am attracted to biologically, male identifing and just generally manly men. Again, no issue to people who arent, but thats just my preference. This is just a small example of the things that have happened to me by women who are attracted to other women, and transgender people. And due to all of that I developed a fear of trusting or becoming friends with females who were in that community. I couldnt speak about it for years because even to a therapist I was terrified I would be labelled as homophobic. But eventually I got the courage and I spoke to my therapist about it. I was told that it was actually pretty common for straight people to experience things like this and to develop fears of people from the communiuty, especially due to not being able to speak out about it. I also was confirmed that I did have a phobia due to trauma (which I would like to note is possible to have while still being an ally and supporting the community!!). I have been working on it for many years and although I do sometimes get scared by being alone/close friends with women in the community, I now am so so much better. I have so many absolutely wonderful close friends who are women, as well as one of my best friends is mtf trans!! And I loveee talking to her about girly things and about how she can come and try my clothes on etc! I remember once on twitter I accidentally came across a whole community of 'straight/cis haters' who say things like cis/straight people have no rights and cant complain about anything, or things like cis/straight doesnt exist. And I commented literally just a sad face and the amount of hate I got was so bad I had to delete my account. I was being called slurs, horrible insults, being called a bigot and homophobic, being told I should kill myself and I deserve any trauma/assult that I get. It was so so stressful and scared me so much. I was only 15 or so. I still am an ally after all of this, and always will be. But I am so scared for all the younger generation being taught at very very very young ages that they can identify as whatever they want and start taking dangerous hormones and getting surgeris before they even start puberty. I didnt even understand what sex or gay was until I was like 11, and even then I learned quite young as I was groomed. I absolutely think its good to teach young people about safe sex and identities etc, but I believe this should be done when they are at an appropriate age to be able to understand and form their own opinion. While obviously its good for them to be aware and respect people who identify differently as they are being bruought up. When I was younger I thought I was a rabbit , and if I was taught that I can identify as whatver I want and especially with so so so many children now joining the community, I probably would too as I wouldnt want to be the odd one out. I am not saying that all people of the community are doing it for the 'trend' but I absolutely believe that a big portion, especially children are.",0

To say sex and gender is different is actually a contradiction. By this theory you wouldn't even be able to assume what a male body is or a female body is because both sex are subject to either body. Which then means you go by feeling which doesn't make any sense. What exactly are the feelings of that of a women and that of a man when everyone has completely different feelings?,0
"It's all pretty murky. The entire hormone system is replaced, the fat distribution on the body changes, the voice changes.. HRT changes basically everything but the bones, and even some ""natural born"" women have bones that are closer to men's than to women's. That doesn't make them not women on a scientific level.  A trans woman who has undergone hormone therapy is not the same thing as a cis woman, but they're also completely different from a man both physically and mentally.",0

I like Caitlyn. She thinks of others and not just herself and she loves America. I believe the primary purpose of all adults is to be a protector of children.

There is so much wrong here. First and foremost. God never ever makes mistakes. If HE made you male... You are a man and if HE made you female... You're a woman. Period!!! These bodies are given to us perfectly made in the image of our Heavenly Father. This boy needs deliverance.  Honour your mother and father.  The disrespect is unbelievable and these shows just encourages this disrespectful behaviour.  Why should this mother change to make the child happy??  Why should she go against the sanctity of her marriage to please her child???  People need to start reading the Bible. Really...!!!,1
Broke my heart completely. I cried and decided If I ever become a mother I will raise my kid as gender fluid and my kid will decide the gender for itself,0

" Yes and no. Yes, studies in neurobiology - showing, for example, that the brain structure of a trans individuals more closely resembles the gender to which they identity than their ""biological sex""- is literally what's in their heads, but it's biology. It's not ""feelings"" or ""opinion."" And the reason many biologists reject the notion that sex (never mind, gender) is binary is because of data in genetics and endocrinology - not what's in people's heads. We know that Sex and sexual identity is the result of an interplay of different and complex biological markers that usually, but do not always, align.

I am sorry to inform you that there are lots of countries where civil and religious marriage are completely separated, though most people might chose to do one ceremony for both, while other chose to do only the civil marriage, or even marry civilly many times, which is certainly not possible for religious marriage unless your previous partner is dead.

 If you say that God only created man and woman and no one can change that to a lgbtq + person then that doesn't come across as kind and compassionate if you would ask me.   It is also true that there are not two human beings on the planet that are equally maskulin or feminin. There are cases in which a boy or man is so feminin that they identify themselves more as a girl or woman then as a boy or man.,0

I guess I'll have to spell it out for you.  I don't hate religion or religious people.  I was putting the shoe on the other foot.

"The act of homosexuality….is it worth it?   The gender of a person is determined the moment of birth by the on-duty gynecologist. A preference for liking the same gender is a personal preference and the change of genital organs by invasive surgery does not change a person’s gender it only changes a person’s appearance!  The act of homosexuality is not an “innocent” sexual preference, is an act that is disgraceful and countermand to the Law and the Commandments of God. The answer that is crystal clear is not given by philosophy or sociology but by the Word of God, the Holy Bible. The Holy Bible is not an invention of the mind of man, it is Revelation from God. The act of homosexuality introduces men and women into the spiritual realm of ~lawfully belonging to the devil~ because of disobedience to the commandments of God , the same way obedience to Christian Baptism as delivered by the Holy Spirit 2000 years ago introduces men and women to a spiritual realm of lawfully uniting with God!   New Testament [1 Corinthians 6:9] 9 Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind  Old Testament [Leviticus 20:13] If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination:"" they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them.""

Yes, ideally, the love of a father is important, unfortunately, there are many families where the father figure is missing, or if present, unavailable to love.

A heterosexual man cannot change his sexual desire and the same applies for homosexual men/women.

"I'm still watching this, but the main point theme I'm gathering is not necessarily LGBT, but it is people choosing to be a bad faith actor online, or interpersonally irl. I'm personally not a fan of any kind of bullying, and organized religion especially fundamentalists, and I will always prefer a logical conversation around facts than personal attacking.  I do not agree that peoplr in the lgbtq community have to always appear to be the better person in order to be accepted, or worse ""tolerated"". That is not proper and blankets over very dangerous situations that many queer folks have to live through day to day. This argument of turning the other cheek and being above insults or harassment is more fitting to fandom communities, like anime, furries, comics, larping... the list is exhaustive. But it is bad advice when it comes to human rights and identity minorities. The bullied shouldn't bully, that's common sense of course, but seeing the human and the context behind a situation is essential in order not to end up victim blaming a person who is lashing out possibly to protect themselves. Those who are actually bullying back need firm and fair discussion, but not hate and isolation. Especially if they are truly alone and suffering without proper help, which happens often to LGBTQ people.  I don't know if you identify with the LGBTQ community yourself, but you have certainly spoken for our community in parts of this video and some of the messaging you've given off can be harmful, especially to the young people in our communities. Speaking objectively as a person from the outside looking in is well and good, but be careful issuing what-to-dos with prescriptive views.  What I do agree on is that online death threats, doxxing, personal attacks and harassment is no way to interact with anyone online. If you need to set up boundaries or contact authorities on something do so. Curate your online space, especially if someone is stalking you or telling you to die. And as far as young children being dicks online, there needs to be more stringent internet access laws that will hold parents and legal guardians accountable for any harassment or threats their minor(s) commit. As well as mandatory counseling issued for kid and parent with serious or repeated offenses.  Anyways thanks for your time, these are some of my thoughts on the matter, albeit a little long winded but that's just how my brain goes. I've seen a lot of culture shifts in my time, and behavior across the board has become legit incendiary especially since around 2015. But minority groups always have bumps in the road like this when having to defend their living rights, especially when some members clearly don't handle it in healthy ways or are just pushed way past breaking points. Stay safe.",0
"You can measure the earth's temperature. A persons gender identity is a little more vague imo.   In ancient Scotland, Rome, and Greece, the manliest men wore skirts.

And perhaps you're right maybe there is a God watching down deciding weather i go to hevan and hell or maybe there are multiple gods or maybe there is nothing i would act the same if i knew any of those to be true i wouldn't act differently to make a god happy if you're god truly believes that gays deserve to be punished for all eternity then i don't agree with youre god morally if that casts me into eternal suffering so be it.,0

Let me see if I’ve got this right.  A man who changed his identity to a woman with male genitals gets married to a woman who changed her identity to becomes a man with female genitalia because the woman who looks like a man wants to be  *****by a man who looks like a woman and the man who identifies as a female wants to ***  a woman who looks like a man.,1

 HAYES huh? How is what i am saying in any way contradicting what you say? I mean there is biological gender which the same as sex. Then there is psychological or chosen/assumed gender. You seem to miss the point that not every woman who is psychologically a woman (despite having a penis) is able to be sexually attracted to female genitalia (despite them belonging to a human identifying as male). In this case they are able to be sexually aroused by each other despite their sexual organs not matching their identity which makes this couple unique and complex.

Instead, we should strive to see everyone as Christ does, people/sinners who are loved by him and in need of salvation.   For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten some, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.

While some are people just tolerate the idea of being trans, instead of agreeing with them, it is definitely weird to bully 41% of trans people into suicide and depression.

"Hmm interesting but i’d have to differ. There have been sexologists explaining the terminological distinction between biological sex and gender as a role around the 50s. Sex and gender in modern discussion were never synonyms, and if used that way, were used incorrectly. They're very different concepts. To add, saying accepting their natural sex is still not related to this case, they’re a transgender couple, not transexual, they’re not “dna-phobic” sex is irrelevant here",0

" that's still different. It'll be weird to call transwomen a ""he."" They no longer have same hormones as males because they already went through feminization process like injections. I'm not saying they are same as biological woman, but they aren't same as men. Their male hormones are unbalanced and suppressed to some extent. So it wouldn't make sense to call them ""he."" Besides that, dog isn't a gender. It's an animal that doesn't have a capacity to construct gender roles. We do.   Biological women and transwomen are different. Calling them ""she"" isn't harmful as it seems. Of course, transwomen can have different category and calling them ""she"" at the same time doesn't seem harmful.  Also, feminine males exists but they are NOT transwomen. They have 100% male hormones and never used injections to feminize their bodies like transwomen do.

He had had an ongoing and heartbreaking affair with Camilla for decades. I find it a little hypocritical to badmouth the intellect of Harry, the fickle behavior of Diana and Meghan, which is BS. I thought you would have had a vile distaste wrt Andrew's actions and would have forged forth with an fiesty expose highlighting it. P.s. Tom is despicable, spewing negative words against Diana specifically. She went above and beyond highlighting many of the harsh realities that the rest of the world should be aware of. She was organic in her carrying out her duties by going to hospitals, picking up babies dying from malnutrition, visiting and showing empathy to AIDS victims and hugging children with missing limbs due to landmines.

" You might want to give the video another watch. You seem to have allowed the information to go over your head.  And there are, in America and the developed world, no laws which allow for discrimination against transgender individuals. At best, there are laws that ensure that they are treated as any other member of their sex is treated, and laws to protect children from being groomed into developing gender dysphoria. That's the opposite of discrimination, that's treating them the same as everyone else. What trans-activists lobby for is discrimination.",1

Somewhere I felt that this might be a true story,this might be something which is what they did out of love.They might have sacrificed their gender discomforts just to step up in the roles to fulfill dreams.That's all that I was saying.

You don't know better than the person going through it.",0
I’m just thrilled I didn’t find a bunch of negative comments. This story makes me happy these two found each other. I don’t think most people truly can imagine the struggle of a trans person.

"Again, like I've said many times, I NEVER said that the gay community is a problem or that this ONE situation shows that gay people are bad or some idiotic statement like that (you can literally read the comments I've replied to. I've elaborated on this multiple times). I'll say this again, the PROBLEM lies in the fact that SOCIETY (gay OR NOT) are blind to things like this because they're so fixed on defending the minority that they don't even consider the fact that they could be in the wrong.   I don't care about what the video says. I am stating what I believe to be the issue, and it's not the gay community, it's today's SOCIETY. The video holds no weight in this conversation, especially considering that my perspective isn't even entirely parallel to his.  If you didn't SEE what happened, you should never DEFEND one side or the other. You should just mind your own business. Those people did NOT keep to themselves despite them having no knowledge of the situation. Which is, AGAIN, MY problem with it.  I NEVER ""framed"" sexual assault on someone because of their sexuality. The only reason his sexuality matters is because it SHOWS you why people sided with him. I very briefly directed the focus to his sexuality because he USED it so that everyone would believe he was the victim.

"and that is why REAL Muslims want you dead. So you ignore the majority of teachings that teach of jihad, rape, child molesting, women having no rights as to a man...and focas on the ""good"" So do you think the Quran is wrong? Be careful, I wouldn't want your pedophile murderous psychopath to be upset with you. That's not a follower of Alah or Mohammed!  You worship the god YOU created. You're clearly ignorant of your own religion and others. Your logic says that you can be a goldfish if you'd want.  The Quran contains at least 109 verses that call Muslims to war with nonbelievers for the sake of Islamic rule. Some are quite graphic, with commands to chop off heads and fingers and kill infidels wherever they may be hiding. Muslims who do not join the fight are called 'hypocrites' and warned that Allah will send them to Hell if they do not join the slaughter.",0

"Exactly, just like how we can’t change our attraction, straight people can’t change it either. I’ve always found it so odd when other LGBTQ individuals say they “hate straight people.” Like, do you hate them for liking the opposite sex? Or do you hate the straight people who have oppressed our community for who knows how long?",0
"I’m young in my late 20s so perhaps I was raised with older mentalities from the family.. that being said I encourage and support gay people. Becoming a trans-gender I don’t even mind necessarily. (Look how you want) shit even be called what you want I understand that but, it LITERALLY doesn’t make sense how you can think you are suddenly a real (genetic) male or a suddenly real female.. again, no problem with how people change their looks or what they want to be called, but just because that’s the way I think and say my son or daughter changed and denied what I said and said it wasn’t true…. I would NEVER fucking abuse them or DISOWN them and hate on them..wtf. We’re all raised differently, and at a certain age we all become to think and decide for ourselves… the biggest thing you have to instill in yourself is to be RESPECTFUL, REGARDLESS",0
This is what Quran commands to Muslim: Hate &amp; kill your own children when they're NOT STRAIGHT(homosexual transgender).,1
We must be careful how we treat people. We can't be unkind and judgmental. We must embrace and love them. That doesn't mean we condone their sin. If we are honest with ourselves we have all struggled with some form of sin. These people need our kindness and compassion just like a drug addict or a murderer does. The words of Christ...he who is without sin let him cast the first stone. All of us must stand before Him one day and give an account. There will be no mercy for those who have shown no mercy.,0

"I think they're hated so much because they can convince young gay people in homophobic households that they need to suppress their sexuality and pretend to like women, you cannot change sexuality...

"also, please do some research. Like, dude, you speak with absolute confidence that the findings of the scientific community line up with your predetermined beliefs but you have never actually done research on this issue.   If you actually do research you'll find that there are countless examples of gender fluidity, many genders, etc throughout history (today counts as history). If you actually did research you would find that the idea of rigid biologically determined gender is a Western invention and only took over the world when the West did.",0

"Usually the smallest minorities become the loudest and those in power think that that is what the majority wants. I have a gay friend who is so pissed at the fact that the LGBTQ+ community has gone downhill. He is a great friend and even though I am a Christian and don't agree with his lifestyle, in the end we both respect each others opinions and I accept his lifestyle we are still in touch and he told me recently that he respects the viewpoints of Christians and Muslims because of how I treated him. And as a Christian I don't mind if you are gay; but I hope you respect the opinions of others.",1
"These people are mentally ill, believing that they are someone different inside from the something that is defined by the outside (physical). It's sad that they've gotten trapped in this lifestyle. They should work on trying to get out and maybe discouraging others from joining it. They are not going to be accepted into society as women (because they aren't). This documentary focuses on this being society's fault rather than their delusions and chosen lifestyle.",1

"The words in the bible were compiled by men. If women had compiled the words in the bible, the story would be, that men should be subservient to women, and had women been more powerful in the physical sense than men, women would have in thought and deed compiled every last word in the bible. Any lip from the men, and the women would have laid a royal beating on the men, to tune them in to that ""truth,"" that physical might, is the will of the all-powerful Goddess ... not the will of a wimpy weakling of a god.",0

"They are also sons of God. What I do not understand is why they are so badly economically the travesty in a culture where women are humiliated.

In conclusion, that why everybody would be happy.",0
"HiJiNx X Oh, how you sound so much like the doubting disciple Thomas.  John 20:24-29 KJV [24] But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came. [25] The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe. [26] And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you. [27] Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing. [28] And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God. [29] Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed. It’s up to you if you want to believe in God. It requires faith; faith comes by hearing, and by hearing the word of God.",0

 6000 They transitioned to the opposite sex because they are Transgender. Straight people dont undergo surgery to become one of the opposite sex... so they can feel comfortable in their own skin.

" it's mostly based on my own meditation, research and reasoning.  Plus buddhism teaching (like karma) and Christianity (jesus teaching about compassion and love) resonates the most to me.  My parents picked christian school at that time because it's one of the best private school in my country, education wise. Plus they don't mind if we believe in other religion as long as you're not hurting anybody or make others suffer.  I believe in God (all that is, was and will be).

What this man is dealing with, he’s lying to himself. He has not come to terms with himself.

"To elaborate, this is why people with dysphoria go to therapists/counselors. Sometimes the uncomfortableness stems from trauma or a problem with body image (which can be treated by therapy and counseling without gender transition). Sometimes the uncomfortableness stems from an internal incongruence with the brain and body (which can be treated by medication/surgery for gender transition). An expert would know a lot about this stuff so usually they can determine if someone with gender dysphoria is in need of transitioning.",0

Selah.  4 There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the most High.  5 God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help her, and that right early.  6 The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his voice, the earth melted.  7 The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.  8 Come, behold the works of the Lord, what desolations he hath made in the earth.  9 He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariot in the fire.  10 Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth.  11 The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge.

"This is my understanding of the counter argument: As a society, let’s create a clear distinction between gender and sex. Females are XX, males are XY. We all should agree, since it’s a scientific distinction. However, let’s use man and woman as a gender descriptor, a descriptive definition instead of a prescriptive definition. “Man” and “woman” can be a social archetype that people can choose to identify with, which can be evident by their outward appearance. Men are masculine, women are feminine. A female with XX chromosomes can be muscular and have a beard. They are identifying themselves with the man archetype, so let’s refer to them as a man. By calling this person a man, we would not be defying the scientific truth that their sex is female, but we would be respecting their choice to identify as a man. They would be a “real man,” because “man” is just a gender archetype.  I don’t see the harm in this. It does not ignore the scientific definition of sex, and it seems to be a succinct way to be more accepting of the preferred identity of transgender people. What do you think?  I also don’t like the idea of putting in a law to force someone to call someone what they want to be called. I think this happened in Canada because being transgender is still taboo. It’s an identity that many people don’t accept, so the prevalence of spitefully misgendering the transgender folks is high. I’d like to think that, after normalizing the concept over time, it becomes a social taboo to misgender, and legal enforcement wouldn’t even need to be in political discourse.",0

And me disagreeing with this does not affect you either. I never have and never will direct hatred towards anyone but that does not mean I have to agree. They knew what they were going to get into when they made that decision, that does not mean every single person on earth has to agree.

Through conviction of the Holy Spirit, he was able to see the deathtrap he unwittingly walked into as a young man.

I’m shocked by Tyson’s response here. Based on everything I’ve heard from him he always stuck with science and even laughed and mocked those that go against science “truth”…But here he dances around defending the science of man being man and a woman being a woman?

They just dont have certain man and woman parts because those parts belong to the original sex/gender you were born into the world with. That's it.

A man is born with certain parts because that's just what nature intended and a woman is born with certain parts as well called biological parts. Both man and woman are born with estrogen and testosterone just depending on what sex you're born with for example, if you were born a man, you'll have more testosterone which develops a man's type of penis called the penis and if you're born a woman, youll have more estrogen which creates the woman's penis called the clitoris and vagina. That's it. Biological just means certain nature giving parts that belong to which ever sex/gender you came into the human world with. That's it. Not having a uterus, eggs, etc. doesn't mean that a trans woman isn't a woman, it just means that she's a woman that doesn't have a uterus.

I do have an idea about how we can help them ""satisfy their need"" without harming others, but it's probably controversial. in my opinion, certain such videos of, well, beastiality and such might need to be allowed(since being allowed to do/see such things in fiction as something fake has been shown to reduce the illegal related action in real life), but with  massive  restrictions(so that the content itself doesn't harm the people we're trying to protect). so, no real x(children or animals) must be a part of the creation of the video(self explanatory why), it needs to be difficult to access(so people don't accidentally get to it, mostly applies to pedo content I think since we don't want children to see that especially), and also warnings about how replicating such behaviors is illegal, and the public should also still not be accepting of it IRL(to prevent people from replicating it). it's definitely not a great solution in my opinion, but it does help both sides... maybe. it might also need some more research(preferably general research rather then on the specific topic since this also applies to violence in video games and movies, so we can research before risking trying something new)",0

Those in the center are many but are pretty quiet so we tend to think the loud fringe are the majority. Right now people in the center are focused on fiscal issues.

So now let’s take all the rights of men away, castrate, and put tracking chips in them. They’re not allow to cohabitate. Assets are frozen. etc.   it’s the same stupidity that went into a scientific paper that a person experiencing gender euphoria can make a group of healthy people experience the same thing.   it’s based upon the likelihood of a group “trending”. that scientifically had nothing to do with transgender issues. It’s a group of people brainwashed by society to accept what the group is doing. which is to be forced into straightness and gender roles.  in a free society, no one acts that way. US is not so free. it enforces “assimilation”. that’s the key issue.   if a person in the group is a drinker and seen as fun or positive, the group becomes a drinker.  we’re not banning drinks. society forced assimilation is to blame.   telling a child during development to be open with discovering themselves and accepting who they are. do not adapt to others.",0

"Even if you believe someone who is transgender has a mental condition, the mom's approach is not one that is going to be helpful to her child. You wouldn't tell someone with autism or ADHD to 'act normally' or spend time harshly denying the reality of a family member with an illness that gives them delusions, or call them names or refuse to be seen with them in public, and certainly wouldn't hit them or tell them to kill themselves, or at least a parent who wants to help them would not do so. The first thing to do is make sure the individual with a mental condition feels safe and can trust you.

I'm over arguing over this when all you want to do is blow this out of proportion over something that frankly does not matter. And there has been evidence, and plenty of it, that this can be harmful to children. Move on! And lastly, changing your gender is a conscious choice someone has to make. I don't know what is wrong, but you need to do more research. I have done plenty and what you are saying is idiotic, unproven, and downright mind boggling. Being transgender is not natural, you have to take medication to alter your NATURAL hormones, and undergo SURGERY to achieve what you wish. That is the most unnatural thing possible, if it WAS then we'd be able to do it with the will of our mind and change genders ourselves like some animals can achieve. Stop attacking me when I only disagree with their lifestyle and them blasting it all over the news. That does NOT mean I will treat them any differently if I met them in real life. And I am sorry, but just because you are an expert it does NOT mean you will agree. There are plenty of experts in EVERY field imaginable with the SAME DEGREE that have different views. And after reading back through your comment, me disagreeing with them is harmful if they are transgender? ARE YOU KIDDING ME? YOU disagreeing with me right now is harmful if we are looking at it through your eyes. Disagreeing does NOT equal hate. If you think so, then you are part of the problem. Stop for a second and accept that people can have different views. If you can't then please go see an 'expert' yourself. I would NEVER treat them horribly, I disagree with what they chose BUT I can actually be a normal and decent human being and not ""be harmful"" to them as you put it. It's funny how you say my opinion is invalid, but your opinion is valid just because you go along with it.

I’ve read that they just STOP TAKING THEIR MALE HORMONES SO THEIR PERIODS START UP AGAIN AND THEN PROCEED TO GET PREGNANT LIKE ANY other woman.

I didn’t say that they were lying. I said the story is either a misrepresentation, or an outright lie. They likely did not know the full story, and sided with the gay dude because they didn’t know what he did.

Also, as a biological male, you cannot know how a woman feels because you would need to have lived in a real female body to know that. If you don't know how a woman feels, you can't ""identify"" yourself as a woman. Because of this:  Gender=Sex  Man=Male  Woman=female  And gender is not an ""identity"".",1

"When I was living in Texas, the bible belt area, I was in high school and managed to make friends with the weird click. These are the people that were the outcasts of the area but they are very friendly and accepting. I was super shy and didn't talk a whole lot for other reasons but they still took me in and I felt like I had a place to be. One of my friends who is bi and I guess the best way to put it fell into the Shaman religion was an A+ student with an open heart of gold. Never saw her get angry and she always know how to talk to people and explain why they are wrong or right. During the end of the year before she finished high school she had plans on being a teacher and one of her teachers (English teacher) said that she would write her a very positive letter for the college she was aiming at. The only time I saw her cry was after she told us what happened... The teacher found out she is a lesbian (she is bi, just not sure if the teacher knew). Once she found out that my friend wasn't following the bible to the letter decided to scrap the letter (I think she wrote a disapproving letter in fact) then lost her final exam score and tried to fail my friend.  This was back in 2009 in a place that didn't accepted people for who they are. Nowadays, instead of having injustice like this you have people on a power trip quick to draw their ""you're the homophobic"" instead of understanding. I am bi myself with a pagan background (within my family) and I do try to create distance with people who ""support"" the LGBTQ group by telling others to kill themselves or that they need to stop their religion because that is at blame or avoid understanding where the person is coming from. I support the truth. Anything that tries to hide it, dismiss it, or ignore it isn't something I want to be part of.

"That’s actually the case for most issues and for most people. However, trans people can’t simply “learn” to accept their parts. There’s scientific studies that show an inherent difference between their brain’s sex, and their physical sex at birth. This is the reason most trans people have dysphoria, and that dysphoria still exists even with therapy/counseling to attempting to remove it. (Usually trans ppl get a diagnosis for gender dysphoria from an expert to see if the issue is internal [requiring physical transition] or external [not requiring transition])",0

"No clue why it would have gotten taken down but here a list of people throughout history. Number 8 is very interesting.  Alan L. Hart(Trans man 1890 - 1962) - trans man known for his contibution to x-ray photography and tuberculosis research.  Chevalière d'Éon(Trans woman 1728 - 1810) - A French diplomat who worked as a spy and a soldier during the seven years war.  Eleanor Rykener(Trans woman arrested 1394 for pr*stit*tion) - before her arrest she worked as a s*x worker but after, she left london. She then worked as a embroideress and barmaid. Both jobs held almost exclusively by women at the time.  Charley Parkhurst(Trans man 1812 - 1879) - was known as one of the greatest stage coach running over mt. Madonna. His secret was revealed after his death.  Lucy Anderson Hicks(Trans woman 1886 - 1954) - her second husband was Reuben Anderson who worked for the military. They were both sentenced to fraud cause she cashed checks as the wife of a us soldier but the jury didn't believe her.  Willner Broadnax (Trans man 1916 - 1992) - Talented gospel quartet singer  Sir Lady Java (Trans Woman 1943 - today) - exotic dancer at nightclubs known for her perfect hourglass.  Elagabalus (Supposed trans woman ruled 218 - 222 AD) - wore clothes typically worn by women. ""They were annoyed when they saw the emperor, his eyes painted and cheeks rouged"" Herodian [5.6.10] ""He asked the physicians to a woman's vagina in his body by means of incision"" Cassius Dio [80.11] This one is debatable because these were written in a very negative manner because Elagabalus' was not a very liked emperor and trans ideals were considered sinful at the time so they could have been lying.  Stella Ernest Boulton (Trans woman 1847 - 1904) + Fanny William Park(Trans woman 1846 - 1881) They were both close friends and went out publicly dressed in victorian dress. They were arrested in 1870 for (I forget the actual name of the offence. Unnatural something) dressing in women's attire.",0

" Devil’s Advocate  God is perfectly just, and perfectly merciful. Because he is just, he cannot just wave off mankind's wickedness. That is why he sent Jesus, who was fully God, fully man, and completely without sin, to take on all of the horrible death that we, by birthright and by our own inevitable sins, should suffer. This is why if you call on and believe in Jesus as your savior and Lord, you will be saved. This is God's perfect plan, that both fulfills the just law, and saves those who will honor him and know that they cannot save themselves, but can only be saved through grace.  He not only gave us Jesus who taught many while he was on earth, but he also gave us the Bible, which is his very word, inspired through different authors in an epic story that spans from creation to revelation of the end times, (and is the most historically accurate book ever written by the way), from which you can learn of Him, his character, and his love. Christians aren't perfect, we don't even agreed with each other in some things, and there are many who claim to be us when in truth they are not. Thus, I defer my imperfect understanding to God's perfect word on your previous questions. Romans 9: 14-24 says: What shall we say then? Is there injustice on God's part? By no means! For he says to Moses, ""I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion."" So then it depends not on human will or exertion, but on God, who has mercy. For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, ""For this very purpose I have raised you up, that I might show my power in you, and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth."" So then he has mercy on whomever he wills, and he hardens whomever he wills. You will say to me then, ""Why does he still find fault? For who can resist his will?"" But who are you, O man, to answer back to God? Will what is molded say to its molder, ""Why have you made me like this?"" Has the potter no right over the clay, to make out of the same lump one vessel for honorable use and another for dishonorable use? What if God, desiring to show his wrath and to make known his power, has endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction, in order to make known the riches of his glory for vessels of mercy, which he has prepared beforehand for glory- even us whom he has called, not from the Jews only but also from the Gentiles?  Hear and believe, Jesus came to save you. God does love those who love and seek him, and he works everything out for his plan. Sometimes these things are too awesome for human understanding, but when you are saved he gives you his Holy Spirit, which reveals the truth to you, bits and pieces at a time, and our understanding will be completed when Jesus returns again. You say that it is unfair for Jesus to speak in parables, or for God to harden the very hearts he created, but who are we to judge fairness? I can't even judge how much I want to eat for breakfast. People can't even judge what sexual orientation or gender they are. All I know is that whoever goes to hell for eternity, and whoever goes to heaven, God will rule justly. There will be no injustice in his decisions. And if you still think it is unfair, then why don't you come to the winning side if eternity? God won't 'force' his way into your life, or shove himself down your throat, but I believe he does work through us, as we are called to tell of Him, and he is always ready to receive you.",1

"This is crazy. People please understand that the LGBTQ+ community does not push anything nor does it recruit straight people into turning gay. All these people ask is to be respected and treated as equals in society. Yes, that means being represented in the media the same way straight couples are. You must understand that not everyone on earth is Christen and has the right to decide that for themselves. That means you have no right to enforce your point of views onto people that do not believe in god. An extreme example being conversion therapy. Conversion therapy is an extremely dangerous practice and has lead to the deaths of thousands of youth through suicide. If you do research on this topic you will find that conversion therapy is not condoned by psychiatric associations across the world. These are people with no psychiatric degrees meddling with the metal well-being of thousands of people leading to catastrophic results. It's great that you are Christen and make sacrifices for god, just please don't make other people who are unwilling, make sacrifices as well.",0

It's the fact that they are not the (old) traditional stereotypical looking couple. Who cares? They love one another, they love their children they are just a little different looking than some other couples.

"Dearest Miss Megyn, I totally understand and, respect Miss Lori Smith's said values and, her need for wanting to defend her position as a graphic designer and, entrepreneur. Democracy, in my humble opinion, is intrinsically linked with free speech. And, koodos to her for defending her values and having the Supreme court to ultimately support or reject her said position. However, I've always felt most uncomfortable with having ""faith"" or ""religion"" as a main arguement to defend a certain position. whatever that might be. For me, it feels like a cop out, like hiding behind the cloak/cloth of the church. It reminds me of how scientologists have taken the position of religion, in order to be exempt from having to pay taxes. I agree wholeheartedly, with wanting to be heard at the Supreme court level, but, to make the arguement solely based on free speech, instead of having personal religious beliefs brought into the fold. For myself, I think this just muddies the waters and really takes away from the real issue, which is having total freedom to be able to decide for oneself, what one feels comfortable doing in a privately owned business without having the government sticking their big fat woke noses, and forcing their ideologies down private citizen's throats.

It seems a lot of Republicans can’t see the trees for the forest regarding the transgendered; instead of pushing back on the entire transgender moment they should focus on the two issues above. Like Tyson mentioned, who cares if someone wants to identify as the opposite sex.

From what I’ve got from the first section  It’s that from seeing one scene play out many times you start seeing a pattern and you start getting used to let’s say arguments starting with so and so you start thinking that every argument should have so and so in it And that’s not your problem for thinking that you have seen a pattern and you can’t change that without seeing more examples  But then again it’s my thought,0
" a lot of trans people die happy with a spouse, friends, family, etc. There is a higher suicide rate amongst them due to the societal view on transgender people, but it’s slow progress to acceptance! Also the skeletal structure thing isn’t true, a lot of skeletons that are dug up can not be accurately depicted as either “man” or “woman” because we aren’t npc’s and it varies from person to person, and is often ambiguous. But even if the skeleton was determined to have more male features, that doesn’t mean the person was biologically male, and even if they were, that doesn’t mean they weren’t trans. Like trans people do not care if there skeleton structure is more like the gender they align with, like what straws are you grasping at for a “gotcha” moment 😂Your points here are mute",0

Don’t blame trans people for trying to make this farce work for them. We’re all doing the best we can with these labels forced on us.",0

The only reason I have a problem with it is because you hate that we are finally receiving the rights we have. Again we are humans first.

That's why the ones that have been delivered are the ones that came to the deliverance conclusion themselves. I am not preaching change, unless you want it.

I was just thinking about this the other day and how I would react. I would try and talk with my child and let them know I can not support the way they want to live their life but while they live at home they will live as the sex they are born with at birth and I will show them respect and not speak against them but as long as they are dependent on me for support they will have to respect my rules and as soon as they are of age they will have to leave and be on their own if they desire to live their life as the opposite sex. I will help them prepare for living outside of the home and arrange for them to have access to all types of contacts to work with them in their transition.,1

However, there's more than just the shape of the sex organ involved, there's also hormones. Hormones have a profound yet subtle effect on our biology, this is proven, and even alter brain chemistry with mood and mentality shifts. So then, what is a woman 'biologically' if every person produces the same hormones as each other, but trans people produce the same level of hormones as the gender they identify as?

 also they have passing privilege meaning kids probably can't tell unless they specifically said something to them. The whole point of being trans is to look like a cis person. Also as a trans kid I can assure you that kids are more accepting these days. Tbh I tend to get asked out more than most of the guys at my school and everyone knows im trans. Girls nowadays like guys who are in touch with their feelings but also guys that can understand their situation. As humans we tend to seek people that understand us and when you're an ftm some girls like it because I know exactly how they feel when certain things happen. Also if there was ever sex involved when know where everything is and can do the job right. Also there isn't any unwanted pregnancy risk either,0

Diana tipped off the press as part of a trade off so they would leave her alone on her private time. Look at any video with her and the level of out of control hounding every step she took would've cause anyone else an anxiety attack after a few days. She eventually made some deals with some media in exchange for some privacy on more private outings or when she was with her kids. I dont blame her tbh.,0

"This is my opinion on the lgbt   Sex was supposed to be for showing intimate emotion and procreation, you cannot separate them, but westerners have made sex meaningless, just something that you do for nightstands/fornication. That’s when the gays came out of their closets and thought “this is our perfect time to shine.”   Societies such as ancient Japan, ancient Greek, ancient Rome, Mesopotamia, Chinese Han dynasty, ancient Egypt, and such societies had no limits to sex and accepted homosexuality and even incesst because fornication was normal just like today in the west.   sex is supposed to be something sacred that is supposed to be for the right one. Once you found the right spouse that you’re gonna have children with, then sex is supposed to happen, sex was supposed to be something that connected spouses and the children tightened that bond.",1

Just gonna leave this here for you 😉  Today the Protecting Children from Gender Mutilation Act was officially filed in Tennessee.

her mother has no right to decide whether Ariana is a male or a female. If Ariana identifies and feels more comfortable as the female gender that should be accepted. Not supporting your kids for who they are can actually leave them with depression. If you were a parent you wouldnt want your kid to be depressed would you? Thats why supporting and loving your kids for who they are and what they identify as is super important.,0
"doubt the child would want you as their parent either, also people who are saying you shouldnt slap children are people who are saying you shouldnt abuse your child but pop off ig",0
Lol I like how when people see a transgender guy or girl with someone who’s like idk gay or something they are supportive but when two transgender people have kids it’s a problem... like they point is that they are happy as themselves and feel comfortable with how they are. It’s the same with plastic surgery too. When it’s a minor surgery it’s ok but as soon as some drastic thing happens it’s “oooh you look fake” like why can’t people just be happy with themselves,0

It seems to me that they abused their fantasy or feelings to the point that it's going out of control..like a non binary who thinks she's a wolf or an alien, etc. Where and when do we draw the line? It's not far fetched that one day, a 50 year old man who pretends to be a young girl and sexually harrased a real teenager boy and can get away with the law since she identify himself as a young girl.. get my drift?

"Disclaimer: I’m Non-Binary and Bisexual before anyone says I’m homophobic.   A big issue I have with the LGBTQ+ community is people making their orientation their whole personality. I know so many people who only talk about and express their orientation. It’s okay to express it and talk about it but when you make it your whole life it’s quite frankly annoying. And In doing this you push away people who don’t accept LGBTQ ideology. Why would they want to hang around you when all you talk about is how things are “gay” or how you love rainbows. I realize this is a problem that’s exclusive to a small niche of the community, but it’s something I’ve experienced.",0
" of mans fall, sometimes people are born with problems. Society has legalized some that God destroyed Sodom and Gomora over. However, God gives us the grace to bear our burdens. There are psychological problems, pedefiles, etc born but society has not yet legalized these. God does not give those born without problems the right to mistreat anyone, however in Scripture God says"" I am God and I change not"". A lot of the "" climate change"" conversation should think about God being unhappy with us all for whatever our part of the declination of society is.🙏💕",0
I have the opinion that gay is something your born with and is ok to be. Transgender I think is a cause and effect of trauma.

I am a spaceship because I think I was born as a spaceship. Hahahaha omg what happened to this world,1

"How is the bot-thing an argument? You are aware that those bots were programmed by people, right? So, here is the list of ""offensive"" words I used: gay pride, abuse, s*xual education, representative, s*xual identity. Really horrible indeed. However, I'll rephrase: so, how are you being abused, and by whom?  And I totally believe you when you say that this would not be the goal of the LGBT-community (all my gay friends certainly never made a fuss about it.) However, if that is the case, then you should definitely find yourself some better representatives, because the ones you have now are giving the impression that all their lives are exclusively built on are their s*xual identity as well as a victimhood narrative. And by shoving this topic down everybody's throat all the time, you're probably not gaining a lot of allies either.  Oh, and condoning speech police and calling even the mildest criticism ""hate speech"" and ""discrimination"" is not helping your cause either, it just re-inforces the prejudice that the LGBT-community is a bunch of intolerant, narcissistic victimhood-cardplayers who are not able to bear a differing opinion.",1
