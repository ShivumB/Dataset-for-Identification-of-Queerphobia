So if an adult loves a child that is OK? So if an adult loves an animal is that OK? we are normalizing perversion and it’s wrong!  These poor children are very influenced by what is around them.  I think this is so wrong in so many different ways!,1

Everyone talking about how lucas is &quot;based&quot; or whatever but when the interviewer asks &quot;Do you know why you feel that way&quot; he responds with &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot;... there is no logical reason to be hateful.  Poor kid is just surrounded in an environment with hate and they indoctrinated him with this mindset,0
I love the fact that the one kid that didn’t support it honestly didn’t know why.,0

I remember viciously hiding my femininity as a young child and denying any sort of signs of being girly or liking things that might make me seem different .  Seeing Lucas react to this makes me so sad. Because I’ve been him trying to save face for my parents or denying myself my true feelings in hopes I could fix myself . Im very happy Lucas moved on to Makeup and Black Pink .,0

Message:<br>Sometimes don&#39;t hate on people who don&#39;t support the lgtbq+ community its something part of they&#39;re own religion and they can&#39;t change it and I had a friend who doesn&#39;t support it it&#39;s because of they&#39;re religion please respect some people thank you,1
People aren&#39;t born lgtbq they grow up to be lgtbq from lgtbq teachings in school that is the reason why lgtbq actually why lgtbq is growing if you keep a child away from school and also making lgtbq  most places there religion dosent condone it and making lgtbq teachings in school is like giving up a native religion like if you agree,1
Lucas is always right!,0

"I hate that no one is talking about this so i will. When people say: &quot;it’s not natural, even the kids know it’s wrong&quot; it’s not the kids that think that, it’s you. Like Lucas, he had so strong feelings about why it was wrong, but when they asked why he thought that, he simply just said &quot;I don’t know&quot;. Young kids that think like that, it’s usually not their own thought, especially when they don’t even know why they think so. All I’m saying is, influence.",0
Lucas was awesome. That is a genually response with no filters. There still is faith in Humanity.,0
The younger kids are so innocent 😇😂,0
“ This episode of Kids React will discuss the sensitive subject of same-sex marriage which continues to be an issue-“  wait why is it an issue.,0

Message:<br>Sometimes don&#39;t hate on people who don&#39;t support the lgtbq+ community its something part of they&#39;re own religion and they can&#39;t change it and I had a friend who doesn&#39;t support it it&#39;s because of they&#39;re religion please respect some people thank you,1
People aren&#39;t born lgtbq they grow up to be lgtbq from lgtbq teachings in school that is the reason why lgtbq actually why lgtbq is growing if you keep a child away from school and also making lgtbq  most places there religion dosent condone it and making lgtbq teachings in school is like giving up a native religion like if you agree,1

If any of you are gay that’s OK and if anybody bullies you for being that don’t listen to them because they’re probably just having a bad day or something but you be what you wanna be because you are an amazing person and that’s what makes you special :),0

Watching this brought back the exact same hurt I felt in high school when this happened to me. I wasn’t a masculine kid rather very slim and female looking. I hadn’t reached my growth spur yet. My voice was soft and some even said I had feminine tendencies. All I knew is I loved baseball and wanted to play. I remember the coaches son on my little league summer camp team being very aggressive to me because of my looks. Coach had to verbally discipline his own son many times for his outbursts towards me. There were times he aggressively threw a ball at me while I wasn’t looking. I thought growing up a bit and maturing in my looks would change things. In high school I decided to try out for the new baseball team. The first week of practices were great. Then the coach surprisingly pulls me into his office and says I couldn’t play because of my grades and conduct. I was baffled considering I was an honor roll student. I knew something was off. I asked him where did he get that information from. He remained dismissive and kept repeating my grades and conduct was keeping me from playing. It became clear to me I was being discriminated against because of something personal. I tried moving to the track team afterwards and realized he was the same coach over track. I was so hurt I spent the entire high school days retreating to myself. It wasn’t long before I was comfortable with being a loner. It was my immature way of protecting my heart. I didn’t really reach my growth spur until my late 30s. Aging for me took longer than some. During my twenties and early thirties it was evident I was being mistakenly viewed as homosexual because of my feminine like features. I failed miserably trying to get folk to look past my countenance and focus on my personality. It just didn’t come. I carried this anxiety through college and into the workplace. Colleagues would second guess everything I would do or say because of how I appeared to them. I recall mentioning my experience in accounting to a superior. His response was you definitely don’t look like you’re old enough to have completed that many years in accounting. When I revealed my age he still was reluctant to believe me. Watching this video is a stark reminder that this can happen to anyone. I pray this message reaches the heart of every viewer to go against the odds and give people a chance. You never know who you maybe stopping from being an impact to the future you.,0
How to enrage a gay 1: tell them the earth won&#39;t flat 2:tell them child predators aren&#39;t cool 3: read Leviticus 20:13 p.s no one believes your stories its all click bait also we know you were using civilian taxes to your own profit,1

The polar opposite extreme to that is today&#39;s people should be living and dying to the highest standards of quality which would make each and every moment physically, mentally, financially and spiritually beneficial.

instantly knew it was sierra cuz of her jeans lmao,0
i thought fs it was sam lmao,0
Didn&#39;t even watch the video. Paused and looked at everyone&#39;s body language in the beginning. Guessed who it was. Fast forwarded to the the final reveal. I was right. I mean c&#39;mon? I wish these were less obvious lol. The woman who turned out to be the mole had remarkably different posture than everyone else.,0
two years later they all come out as lesbian,0
Why the f did I know it was her so damn fast??,0
I had a crush I watched a f a girl likes u 10 sines she did all of them……………………..I got my hopes up than I found out she was lesbian😭😭😭KARMA WHY!!!!!,0
As soon as they started talking abt nails and sierra said “i bite my nails” i was like Yep sierras the one,0
"I did suspect her, i dont know why i just felt it coming😭",0
"Sorry to say it&#39;s going to be pay day one day. Do not be deceived, God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows.

I FR THOUGHT IT WAS GEORGIA I&#39;m disappointed in my gaydar as a lesbian,0
Isn’t Joey the lesbian? Lol I’m kidding.,0
"I HAVE AN AMAZING GAYDAR<br>Litterally right as soon as I saw Sierra, I was like &quot;It&#39;s her&quot;<br>It also could have been because she looked really anxious within the first ten seconds but-",0
My mind when straight to the tall blonde one with the green cropped shirt and dark jeans,0
I took one look at all of them and immediately found her,0
I knew it was Sierra from the moment I saw her,0
BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE,0
rip off jubilee,0
sierra was giving me bi or in the closet vibes,0
I was a secret lesbian for 32 years. 😆,0

Omg it’s the guy from that one show Haters back off,0
OMG I know it 😂😁,0
"at a very young age i discovered i was les, and still i couldn’t figure it out wow…",0
I knew it was her omg i screamed- my gaydar was RIGHT! i feel so validated as a lesbian,0
I&#39;m bi,0

"I thought Sam was the lesbian, I watched their &#39;and i&#39;m straight&#39; introductions and skipped to the end tho, sooo...",0
"I knew it from the start, woah my gaydar 🫡💅",0
i knew it was her as soon as i heard her trying not to laugh saying “i’m straight”,0
i have heard my calling</b>,0
ommggg I was right 💃,0
"OMG as a lesbian, the first time I saw Sierra I knew! I have a really great gaydar",0
omg I hate LA people …,0
"Wow, it&#39;s almost like lesbians don&#39;t stick to codes from The Walking Stereotype Handbook 🤦‍♀️😂",0
i just read the title and i was like &quot;its me&quot;,0
sierra was acting so straight that i thought she must be the lesbian bc its too much... but then she became so convincing i just ended up confused,0
I knew right from the start that it was  sierra... everything about her was off,0
i had my heart set that it was keeley 😂 would have never expected it to be who it was,0
I thought it was the girl in the orange dress,0
I am the secret Les,0
I THOUGHT IT WAS SAM FOR SUREEEEE,0
I KNEW IT ALL ALONGGGGGGG,0
Man I must be lesbian because I love Pinterest,0
My gaydar was very corrrrect 💅,0
Hi i love you so much,0
I knew it!,0
I’m lesbian lol,0
I KNEW IT 🤣 My Gaydar WORKS,0
Why did I know it was her?😂,0
Am lesbian,0
Sam looks like the type of str8 girl you’ll fall for but you realize you have no chance because she doesn’t have that kind of attraction to girls-,0
I have cut off jeans... I&#39;m straight af.,0
me,0
She should be a actor,0
Omg I was so sure it was Hailey 😭,0
Y’all.. I’m a lesbian and my gaydar was wrong..💀💀,0
Ima lesbian 😮,0
"When he said ‘isn’t cut off jeans a lesbian thing’ and I was like, YES.",0
I knew by the jeans. Every lesbian i know has those jeans,0
Been playing this game for years,0
Sam gives strong bisexual vibes.,0
I knew it,0
SAM HAS SUCH A GAYFACE THO IM SHOCKED,0
my gaydar on point🤣,0
I would&#39;ve failed right at the intro &quot;I&#39;m Strai...start laughing...&quot;,0
I have my nails done long and was a cheerleader and im bi but lesbian for my boo😭😂,0
Just realized I was not subed,0
Tbf half of them were giving closeted or bi vibes,0
The votes are all wrong. It was ME the whole timel I was the secret lesbian &gt;:O,0
At the beginning I thought that it would be Sam or Georgia,0
"When she says she never kiss a girl that&#39;s when my gaydar when off bc every girl has kissed a girl before, if they say otherwise they are lying.",0
I think shows like this make it clear that  stereo types aren&#39;t accurate and that you can&#39;t know someone&#39;s sexuality just by looks👁👄👁,0
I KNEW IT THE FIRST TIME SHE EVEN BREATHED,0
Women. It&#39;s WOMEN.,0
"typing this before seeing the end results, will edit comment after if i get it wrong. I am looking at Sierrah...I&#39;m getting major lesbo vibes from the one in those lesbianish denims lmao its either one of the two blonde girls...who knows..<br><br>EDIT: I FUCKIN KNEW IT LMAOO ITS SIERRAH BRO I KNEW IT",0
My gaydar actually works wow!,0
I thought Keeley was Florrie 💀,0
&quot;HAVE YOU DONE YOUR RESEARCH???&quot; 😤😤,0
Dude. You need to get out the house or something.,0
I hate Sam,0
Lol I knew Sierra from the get she said &quot;check the nails&quot; lolol,0
Trick question I’m the lesbian,0
atp gaydar doesn&#39;t exist lmao,0
"Honestly the fact that Sierra was with her hands a her waist in the beginning just gave it away to me lol, straight woman are always trying to occupy the least space possible",0
So much for female intuition,0
"I wish it had been keely, she&#39;s so fine.",0
"I KNEW IT, but sam was confusing me a bit too",0
"it’s a straight or bi girl thing to be kissin ur friends while drunk, usually bi lmaooo (/hj)",0
It’s giving jubilee,0
I think she did a LOT of research and preparation lmao,0
"Man she got us good, sierra was the last one I expected…",0
Genuinely shocked I got it right,0
MATERIAL GURL,0
Hah i knew it,0
"right when the first round started i knew it was sierra, i just felt like she was too social yk?",0
"Okay but, where did Joey get his corduroy shirt/jacket from? 👀👀",0
I knew it ! Cuz the boyfriend,0
OMG PETER PAN 2003,0
I sussed her from the start us lesbians think alike,0
I knew it from the start 💀,0
"as a bi girl, i know i just would mess up since my gaydar on girls never works",0
My gaydar let me down. I thought it was Keeley at first 😂 But then I ruled her out and went with Sierra. I&#39;ve been failed.,0
I just watched the intro and I knew Sierra was the one qindiwnd,0
my gaydar sences were tingfeling i knew itt HAA,0
"I knew it was her because of the starting pose 😂<br>It was even clearer when a second later I saw the difference with Sam: same pose, different vibes 😂😂😂",0
I guessed who it was straight away just because she had her hands on her hips,0
I&#39;m lessbyin!😍😘😍😘😍😘😍😘,0
Sam <br>I’m single<br>I have a boyfriend <br>I’ve never dated,0
"as a lesbian, i knew it was sierra right away, but if u look at her body language it did look like she was hiding something, she always had her hands hidden",0
My gaydar sucks 😭,0
What’s the point of voting if only Joey votes count,0
"My first guess was Sierra because she knew the specific spots to check, like observing nails and shoes. But then I changed my guesses many times hahah so fun",0
"Since i first saw her i knew she was, but at last minute i changed my opinion but i was right the whole vid😫",0
Damn I literally guessed it <b>straight</b> away,0
Some of the other girls were giving lowkey homophobic... anyway I could tell as soon as I saw her reaction to everyone having kissed a girl,0
I secretly wish it was Sam😅,0
nobody caught when sierra said &#39;femme&#39; lmao that gave it away,0
"I’d just say I’m bi, it’d be a lot harder to figure me out then (if hypothetically I was the lesbian, but I’m pan 💅)",0
"why’d i guess it from the thumbnail, i looked at her and i was looking closely and thought “i can sense that’s a lesbian”",0
I didn’t even watch the video.  I looked at the cover and guessed right.,0
Spoiler it’s all,0
I like Sams style shes cool.,0
Steve and Billy &lt;3,0
I knew it 😂,0
I knew it!! I got it right 😝,0
That was my first guess. But then I guessed like seven people.,0
"As a lesbian, my gaydar needs fixing, I genuinely thought Keelie was lesbian, SHE JUST GIVES THE VIBES YKWIM",0
keeley and georgia,0
For me when I saw Sierra I was like she’s either the most wholesome ally or the soft lesbian we all need in our lives,0
All lesbians with nails be like<br>👁️👄👁️,0
Sam just tell the truth do you have a boyfriend or not?,0
theyre all fruity,0
straight women kissing and making out with women will always continue to baffle me,0
I CALLED IT,0
"At exactly <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjk_A8_SlCQ&amp;t=1m46s"">1:46</a> into the video I do the exact same thing my nails are really short 😂",0
I picked her out first question Idk im just that good at picking out lesbians ..she really gave her self away when she said  reversing turns her on lmao,0
fish?,0
Okay I’m a lesbian I’m not very feminine but some of the stereotypes are kind of offensive,0
"Was it weird I knew from the voice? Right at the beginning, when they said their name and they were straight.",0
me: <b>skips to end of video</b>,0
I spotted her from the start lmao,0
Thought it was Georgia 😃😃 good one,0
I knew she was since she asks all the questions,0
I literally just looked at her and felt the vibes. I didn&#39;t think my gaydar was this good slkdfjdsof,0
Stop she was my last vote bruh she acted so straight,0
"Omg, Sierra was the one person I did not expect it to be. I thought it would be the perfect, straight cheerleader girl cause she just had that vibe. 😭",0
I wanna see Pansexuals,0
omg i need to be on here,0
I knew it 😭😭😭,0
"omg sam, wanted to punch her the whole god damn video",0
"Me, I’m the secret lesbian.",0
Yo I was right!!!,0
i looked at sierra and &quot;hMMMMMMM LESBIANA&quot;,0
I WAS SHOOK BY THE RESULTS I REALLY THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE GEORGIA,0
Why are u coping jubilee,0
her outfit looks like she was trying to look as straight as possible so I felt like it was her right away,0
i knew it i littelary knew the straught looking will be the lesbian,0
I cant help i hate sam sm,0
i thought it was sam😶‍🌫😶,0
"bahaah im lesbian (well bi) and im sitting here ina fur coat, ripped jeans short short top, just took my heals of with a full face of makeup that took half hour, im 13 and yea",0
"&quot;i get good grades, i go to church, im a CHEERLEADER&quot; lmao",0
This one i could win,0
"as a femme lesbian, it&#39;s so funny to hear these straight girls think nails and heels are for straight people and &quot;edginess&quot; and boots are OOP YOU A LESBIAN<br><br>I love my nails and heels<br><br>and boots, ok you got me",0
"I pray these people will read a Bible and find the lord, for he says a man and a woman should be together. I don’t believe people should just be okay with liking boys and girls",1
Who else thought this was CUT till the video ended😅,0
Ok lmao check all of the instas… one of them has 🏳️‍🌈 lmao,0
im shocked-my gaydar broke tf.,0
WHY WAS MY GAYDAR SO OFF. IM MEANT TO KNOW THIS,0
"I&#39;ve always prided myself for my gaydar, and once again, I was right. I guessed Sierra from the very start.",0
YALL MY GAYDAR WAS ON POINT FROM THE GET GO 💅✨,0
"I was looking for the girl who spoke the fastest, and sierra spoke very fast at the beginning, so I feel proud rn.",0
no because i thought it was sierra from the beginning 💀💀,0
I knew before they even started.,0
This was the best one I’ve seen yet! 🙌🏼🤣,0
Ur pfp looks like Simon from americas got talent I love you,0
I&#39;m laughing because I guessed it when she wrote with her left hand lmao. Idek why that made me think she was the lesbian because I (very much a lesbian) am right handed lmao,0
I knew it the second I saw her 😈,0
my gayometer was so right 💋,0
"As a lesbian, I have never been so disappointed in my gaydar 😭",0
i thought it was joey.... oops,0
"I did kind of expect it to be Sierra, the eyeliner really gave it away for me haha",0
She was my first guess 😂😂😂,0
brb yall- i need to go to fix my gaydar rq,0
I could tell it was Sierra from pretty much the start because she was the only one who looked visibly uncomfortable throughout most of the video.,0
i honestly thought it was hailey lol,0
I actually got it right. It was the jeans and the white shoes that sold it for me. 😂 I have the same outfit 🙃,0
Ngl my vote went to the woman I hoped was lesbian.,0
"As a sapphic, i audibly gasped at the reveal. Did not expect that at all honestly 😭",0
I&#39;ve been waiting for so longg,0
Im a lesbian and i got it right away ig its just easy to spot them now WE LOVE TO SEE IT HUNNY,0
People would be voted me straight away sporty and not at all girly,0
"every other girl in the rooms are ally, unless..",0
Bro I knew since the beginning I was like She’s the moll right in the beginning,0
When she said &quot;maybe the chance will come&quot; for kissing a girl I was like: damn don&#39;t get too excited. Which then convinced myself from that joke that it&#39;s her and I was right-,0
"Okok so I, Pan certified 😎💥🔥, saw a vid like this and guessed right for that one, so I decided to test my gaydar again! I guessed Sierra after looking at only the intro so it would really be only gaydar and was surprised to get it right again!",0
"I knew from the start that sierra was the lesbian, her fit really looked like she was playing pretend straight since literary she looks like she came out of 2019 pinterest",0
This just proves my theory: stereotypes are never entirely sufficient to determine one&#39;s orientation. 😏😏😏,0
"I&#39;m lesbian and I didn&#39;t feel identified with any of the stereotipes they said... sooo, Idk...",0
What&#39;s wrong with my belt 😡,0
as a lesbian i hated everything about this video,0
bro i swear it was sam,0
my first question would be asking what they listen to and what they watch also if they are a crystal lady or obsessed with zodiac signs,0
I LOVE RIVERDALE AND JUGHEADDDD,0
Her whole life throughout the video stand out more than the others,0
I knew it was sierra,0
What’s the point of them voting if Joeys vote out votes them.?,0
i don’t vibe with sam,0
I KNEW IT!! IDK WHY BUT BECAUSE IM LESBIAN AND BITE OF MY NAILS AND EVERYTHING REMINDED HER OF MYSELF AAAAAAAA,0
That&#39;s what she said hahahah,0
THE LESBIAN ENERGY I HAVE I KNEW IT WAS HER,0
i thought it was sierra da whole time because she gave me softball girl vibes and they fruity as fudge,0
Me a lesbian: has acrylics…,0
Who&#39;s the secret lesbian: <br>Me duh 🙄,0
im a bisexual person who does cheer im the cheer captain lmfao,0
CALLED IT,0
plot twist its me xD,0
i knew it I knew sierra was les from the moment I saw her lol,0
ik it was her cause as a bi girl I wouldn’t want to kiss a girl for fun knowing i’m bi,0
Am I the only one who guessed it when I first saw rhem,0
"I honestly don&#39;t know how but I knew it was her the whole time, it was just a feeling I guess",0
she was like one of the straightest dressed girls too like I thought that maybe she was throwing everyone off but i didnt know 😭,0
"As a Lesbian, they pribably don&#39;t mean it but they&#39;re giing off stereotypes. Like  I am one of the most girly people you&#39;ll meet and like girly stuff, so now I&#39;m straight?",0
love haily&#39;s dress hate her shoes,0
I clicked faster than a lesbian going to end of the year Subaru sale,0
&quot;But I&#39;m a Cheerleader&quot;,0
Littt💥💥💜💜,0
As a lesbian I called it within first few minutes. It&#39;s the vibe they put off! You can just tell,0
I thought that this would be easy as a lesbian but no I&#39;m just watching this with full confusion,0
Samantha looks so spankable uff,0
I knew instantly from the thumbnail💀💀 it’s her outfit colours,0
sierra was too confrentational at the beggining and quiet at the end it was obvious,0
"I KNEW IT, MY LESBIANISM KNEW SIERRA WAS LESBIAN.",0
"the second she corrected joey by saying &quot;femme&quot; when he said something about a pretty lesbian, i knew it",0
i think as a lesbian I learned that I shouldn&#39;t judge off appearance,0
no one said &quot;sadly i&#39;m straight&quot; I would&#39;ve believed them right away,0
It&#39;s the flamboyant homosexual who&#39;s a lesbian transwoman.,0
I thought it was the girl in the orange dress because she reminds me of Leslie gore.,0
Whhhhhaaaaa what. My gaydar steered me wrong today🤣 like the last person I thought it could be. Definitely thought it was Keeley but probably just wishful thinking more than anything 😂,0
I always thought Pinterest was a straight giveaway lol,0
The material girl was just amazing-😭,0
Yea haha I also have not kissed a girl before yet. I am 22.,0
Sam seemed like a jerck,0
I knew immediately it was sierra when she. Freaked about not kissing girls,0
Fr Jubilee vibes,0
Me: <b>they’re all lesbian they’re all lesbian THEY’RE ALL LESBIAN</b>,0
Sierra and Hailey seem like they&#39;d be such good friendsss,0
I knew based on the intro and the outfit,0
…I forgot that there are other people named Keeley other than me,0
"SAM, MY GIRL? <br><br>YOU SAID YOU WERE A SINGLE LADY, THEN HAD A RELATIONSHIP FOR 1 1/2 YEARS AND THEN 2 1/2 YEARS!? BISH",0
Does sam have ig?,0
My gaydar knew it at first sight,0
So basically trust the nails 💅✨,0
im a lesbian who gets my nails done 😭,0
Who else checked for cuffed jeans…..,0
I knew it was her!,0
For some reason I knew it since the beginning I was like “THIS ONE. she’s a lesbian 100%.”,0
No one can act straight better than a real lesbian🤣🤣🤣,0
Wait….<br>Joey: isn’t Pinterest a lesbian thing?<br>Me: I SAW PINTREST ON MY MOMS PHONE!!!😱😱😱,0
I thought it was sierra or sam 😂,0
STOP SHE PLAYED THAT OFF A LITTLE TOO WELL SHE HAD ME WANTING TO PUNCH HER IN THE FACE-,0
The mole was so believable!! I didn’t guess her either 😅,0
my gaydar worked :),0
"As a lesbian, not surprised that the lesbian was the one who hadn&#39;t kissed a girl at a party. Straight girls are wild and y&#39;all get more action than we do.",0
I knew it! sussed her from the start!!,0
bro  i was so confident that it was sam,0
My gaydar did me well in this one 😌,0
Spoiler.. its me,0
PETER PAN our childhood hottie,0
Lol she was the one I was like ... ur to good..😂,0
i knew it immediately. idk how but i did,0
"As a straight man, I am proud to say that I somehow got this right",0
My gaydar was off the roof I knew Sierra since the second that the video played,0
"I pray these people will read a Bible and find the lord, for he says a man and a woman should be together. I don’t believe people should just be okay with liking boys and girls",1
Sierra looked like she tried to dress overly straight girl so guess my gaydar works well ig lol,0
All of the other people yeah we’ve kissed girls before Sam and Sam in her mind I wish,0
I&#39;m actually so proud of my gaydar for getting it right lol,0
i was going for sam but i think i just had a crush on her,0
I could&#39;ve sworn it was Sam😶,0
I love everyone here,0
I love these videos I literally never expected her to be the mole I was so off,0
"WHEN SHE SAID THE REVERSE THING I WAS LIKE, THAT DOESN&#39;T MAKE SENSE",0
I got it at the backing up lol,0
As a lesbian I was so excited when they said check the nails because my nails are so short,0
pov: u skipped to the end just to see who it was 😂😂,0
I had a kindergarten bf and omg crazy lol 😝,0
I knew it from the start,0
I really thought it was Sam,0
STOP I WAS RIGHT,0
And the OSCAR goes to…,0
"My gaydar was absolutely correct, feeling proud of myself being able to guess correctly from the start🙈☺️",0
Sam was so suspisus when she said she thought it was try and find the straight person,0
"i was right lmao, she has &quot;i listen to girl in red and clairo&quot; idk-💀",0
I knew it was Sierra &gt;:},0
as a sapphic I took one look at the thumbnail and immediately knew who it was,0
OMG I was so wrong. I thought it was Georgia and Sierra was my last choice. Lol.,0
i was a cheerleader and a back spot and i’m not straight,0
"Ironically, everyone had trouble with the box at first.",0
Bro what,0
I guessed at first it was sierra but I got guilty when she talked about her nails and just said it&#39;s probably sam,0
Okay guys hear me out with Georgia…🤭,0
Guessed it,0
YO I KNEW IT WAS HER,0
"I was thinking about coming out to my friend as bi, and I think it would be really funny to send a screenshot of the thumbnail for a video like this about bisexuals lololol",0
As a str8 person I also thought it was keeley,0
Ya know I was sure it wasn’t Sierra and then closer to the end of the video I caught her looking at miss orange dresses 🍒 - that was the moment I knew,0
giving me a jubilee vibe,0
lesbians always win,0
i thought it was sam bro,0
Mfs names jake: 😱❤️,0
She answered about peen based on research not experience so that done it for me,0
POV your a homophobic watching this,0
i literally guessed it was her before the video even started… how did they not get it??,0
❤️❤️❤️❤️,0
"I was secretly hoping it’s Georgia, she’s gorgeous. ❤️😩",0
need more representation in these videos :(,0
MY GAYDAR WAS RIGHT!!!,0
Wait Peter Pan in the live action was my first crush too….,0
"me, i was the lesbian",0
I flipping knew ittt,0
"these are so hard bc you second guess yourself so much, but sierra literally just. they look like a lesbian. most of my white lesbian friends look exactly like sierra",0
love the vids,0
I did not think it was sierra AT ALL,0
I’m guessing keley,0
"why&#39;s everyone so shocked, I think it was very obvious....????",0
as soon as they did their intruductions i knew and i guessed right 😭,0
Easy…look for the lesbian eye brows  👁,0
As a bisexual person I knew who it was from the start😌,0
I knew it! She didn&#39;t look very excited when she said that she&#39;d be straight,0
Just as expected,0
I GUESSED IT RIGHT IN THE BEGINNING YESSIR I KNEW IT,0
I could tell on the first round and I could tell immediately so I’m proud that I’ve put my gaydar to use,0
I thought my headphones broke at the start-,0
I&#39;ma lesbian and still I cherr,0
I knew it!!!!!,0
I took one look at sierra and went “it’s her”  😂,0
"You know the lesbian would win, they pretend to be straight :) (haven’t watched the vid and I’m pansexual so no hate to lesbians)",0
This brought back a memory I forgot I had💀,0
That was unexpected!,0
When she says &quot;my nails are really short cuz i bite them&quot; i already had my suspicions cuz i do them too lol,0
I’m a lesbian and I just knew it was gonna be her hha,0
Oml I knew it. She was so awkward with all the questions about what you like most about guys and stuff. And then she get really nervous with the kissing girls stuff😂😂,0
I knew it was her when she acted shocked that girls were kissing each other,0
"When I saw her hands on her hips, confident, and the other girls were all arms to the side or behind them- I Suspected sierra. Then she only had online references for the “ length or girth” question, where the others had an answer.",0
Bruv I knew it as soon as I clicked on the video! Like her outfit = 🏳️‍🌈,0
From first second,0
I knew it:),0
Do you know gem? Cuz she’s bi✨,0
I thought it was her when she introduced herself but I KNEW it was her when I saw her stance while they were all lined up 😂. IYKYK,0
i got it as soon as she intoduced herself. proud of my gaydar,0
I looked at all of them(in the thumbnail) felt a vibe clicked on the video skipped everything till the reveal and I was right🤣,0
I knew it already from the beginning 😂😎,0
I had doubts with the person whos wearin a frickin dress...,0
"I have a great gaydar, but she gave me so many straight vibes 🤣💀",0
I dont think anybody caught how the blonde and blue eyed girl said &quot;Yeah there were like three lesbian cheerleaders&quot; And then the guy said &quot;Are the other two your lesbian friends? and she didnt point out how she had said three and not two,0
based off of nothing i’ve been on this like a minute i think it’s sierra i won’t delete it if it’s wrong,0
I was shocked 😭 I’m not tryna be mean but she seemed like very basic white girl from tiktok,0
wow she sooooold that,0
"I knew it was sierra as soon as she opened her mouth, perks of being very observant of others lol.",0
"first I thought it was Sam, but then the pants and then with length vs width question i got to the conclusion she&#39;s def straight, and my second option was sierra bc of how confused she was about the girls kissing girls in party and the jeans lmao",0
sam seemed so confused the entire time,0
"I knew it was Sierra within the first two minutes.  However, I kept doubting my pick every time Sam lied.  But I never switched.",0
joey in his jubilee era,0
As soon as Sierra said she had never kissed a girl I was like hmmmm.<br>I was so happy when I got it right :DDDD,0
Damn she was such a good actress,0
what’s wrong with my belt,0
I already Thought in the beginning that she was it lol,0
I forsure thought it was Sam. Her answers were all over the place.,0
I wheezed at “material girl”,0
As soon as she came in and said she was straight I could tell she was lying LOL,0
I was shocked 😂 I think I was wishfully thinking it was Georgia ❤️ haha,0
why did i think it was the girl in the dress the entire time-<br><br>she had a vibe yk,0
"If a lesbian has long nails, that means shes single, not that she&#39;s straight",0
i think it&#39;s the first time i actually guessed right from the very beginning,0
‘can we vote for joey’ HAHAH,0
I had a feeling it was her tbh,0
i literally knew it all along,0
"“mom can we have jubilee?”<br>“no honey, we have jubilee at home”<br>the jubilee at home:",0
Haven&#39;t even watched the full video but the guy in the back sounds like David Alverez,0
I literally started the video picked the girl in the green shirt and I got it right 😌,0
Sam pissing me off haha,0
I just wanted it to be Georgia because I think she’s the prettiest 💀,0
JACK ACTUALLY WAS JANE!,0
still dont get how cuffed jeans means youre not straight. it annoys me sm.,0
no bc i was SURE it was kaylee,0
as soon as sierra came on screen in the introduction i was like &quot;its her. i can sense it.&quot;,0
I KNEW ITTTTTTTTT AHHHHHH 😱,0
Ha. Gey.,1
"I mean technically we are all wrong , Joey isn’t a lesbian ..",0
"When sierra said the reverse thing I knew it was a lie, she just saw it on TikTok and copied it",0
I Knew from the Moment i Saw Sierra she was the lesbian,0
"I knew it was Sierra, it was the outfit that seemed the most fruity compared to everyone else’s. But I have to admit that her acting skills were really good, I almost changed my mind.",0
me im the secret lesbian,0
Can anyone give me advice I’m really confused about my sexuality I don’t know if I’m Bi Or A Lesbian can you tell me signs of each because I’m kind of attracted to men but I’m really attracted to women what should I do,0
Wtf I was soo sure that it would be Georgia🥲,0
"I was secretly hoping it&#39;s Georgia, she&#39;s gorgeous.♥️😩",0
"I feel like because Sam came there thinking she was the straight girl among lesbians,  she came there ready to play. She knew all the Lesbian stereotypes... she never heard of &quot;fish in men&#39;s dating photos&quot;, even as a lesbian... I&#39;m aware. Cracked me up",0
even if you are gay I still support you.,1
"John 3:16<br>“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”",1
Aren&#39;t these Vote Videos very sexist ?,0
I thought they all lesbians,0
I guessed it was her from the beginning because she gave off vibes like me. Never been right before,0
All the straight girls were super homophobic and i am so happy their homophobic stereotypes made them lose,0
I not rude or anything but I don&#39;t like gays,1
trisexual. Men women and cats haha,1
Bro sierra was hilarious,0
Chica meterial 😆,0
some of those are bullies fr,0
I knew it was sierra from the BEGINNING OMG !!,0
Keeley reminds me of Sarah Paxton in Aquamarine lol,0
"I was right yesss, my gayradar finally worked",0
I never guess who&#39;s not straight but c&#39;mon it was so obvious 👀,0
I knew it was sierra froom the beginning cuz her shirt was too cottage core,0
I was so sure it was going to be Georgia,0
I knew it she was asking so many questions and she was so suspicious,0
Sam was making me mad 😭,0
Nooooo i knew itttttt,0
I haven’t watched the hole video but I skipted to the reveal and I was right😎,0
Your actually gender inverted. You are a female,1
"my gaydar always on point. i didn’t even watch the vid, skipped to the end and i was right😭",0
Love this video,0
GAYYY😂😂😂,1
God I was off...,0
I&#39;ve been fooled. I thought Georgia&#39;s enthusiasm about peen was try hard. 😭,0
I knew it was her because I am a lesbian too and she did a lot of things that I do,0
I would be lesbian for sam lol,0
"Picked it from the beginning, gotta test the &quot;gaydar&quot;",0
cuffed jeans arent even a lesbian thing LOL,0
"Should have known when she couldn&#39;t answer the length or girth question! <br><br>Also the driving part, she probably likes with girls which I do as well...",0
no i guessed sierra a little only cause she said “fem?” lmfaoo,0
So there&#39;s five girls and one guy but only the guy&#39;s opinion matter or did i just got it wrong?,0
I WAS SO CERTAIN IT WASNT HER WHAT,0
Sams kinda rude.,0
i freaking knew it,0
Imagine liking boys,0
I cant wait.Who&#39;s lesbian?,0
As soon as they walked out I knew who it was!,0
i guessed right. As soon as she put her hands on her hips i knew. Laughs in bisexual,0
Its been less than a minute and here’s my guess: Georgia <br><br>(I’ll edit my reaction when im done with the vid)<br><br>Edit: .0. She was my 2nd choice because of her pants!!!! (And other stuff but what evvvv),0
Why do some people sound so insulted that they’re thought to be lesbians 😭,0
I guessed her at the beginning of the video,0
Okay I’m lesbian and I was a cheerleader I also have long nails,0
gay lol,1
"Damn, I thought it was Joey.",0
All so beautiful,0
To be fair Keeley was so nervous and awkward like in her mind it was saying “I’m not supposed to be here I stick out like a sore thumb” so I fully understand why Joey thought it was her because so did I😂,0
"As a lesbian I thought for sure it was Hailey, I was shook it was Sierra",0
"Joey, I’m living for these! It’s nice to see you out of the house amongst the living. Not that seeing you with your dogs and puppies everyday wasn’t the best. Love you, Joey and your Team 💛🧡",0
wth i did NOT see that coming,0
the girl in the dress reminds me of a sim,0
THE REVERSE THING I DID IR,0
a nightmare,0
"Man, you&#39;re gay from the start, everyone knew.",1
I heard David lollll I knew he was behind this,0
I thought it was keeley bc nobody else said they had a bf and if ur trying to seem straight you’d say that but ig I was wrong💀,0
I don’t like how they judge ..,0
Fem lesbians???,0
wow that was a curveball i didn’t expect her to be lesbian!,0
“can we vote for joey”,0
“i didn’t know what segment we were in”,0
the girl who forgot to mention her boyfriend😭,0
this was so fun!!!!,0
this made me feel smart as soon as she insisted her nails were short bc she bit them i was like “it’s her”,0
"When i saw some cuffed jeans my gaydar stayed low but when i heard u have a boyfriend, my gaydar went THROUGH THE ROOF",0
Once she mentioned theatre I knew it was her. I’m in theatre and there’s like no straights there.,0
I knew it was sierra because I followed her on tik tok,0
CUFFED JESNS ???????? Bro I do mine every day very straight I’m annoyed they weren’t talking abt life experience and stereotyping,0
I knew it.... I&#39;m Sooooo right.!,0
"As soon as she came out to be the only one who hadn&#39;t kissed a girl yet, I knew it was her lmao",0
Your catsexual,1
Does anyone know what keelys Jean are called,0
isn’t this a direct rip off of jubilee videos?,0
The whole video I knew. I dunno why but I just knew.,0
low key sam was getting on my nerves,0
My immediate gut reaction was either Sierra or Georgia. My gaydar does not lie,0
I THOUGHT IT WAS KEELEY TOO 💀,0
I knew it was her the minute she said she’d never kissed a girl lolll,0
&quot;isn&#39;t Pinterest a lesbian thing&quot;<br>my mum using pinterest every single day,0
They are all soooo drop dead gorgeous,0
MAN SHE PLAYED IT SO WELL <br>I WOULD HAVE NEVER GUESSED HER,0

Why is this popping up now?,0

"I came out as bisexual to my family, i wasnt accepted by my parents. But through my parents not liking me as much because of me being bi, my siblings were always there for me and eventually i found my girlfriend, me and her have been together for 4 years now, so no matter what people or social media says, you can be whoever you are, because its your life, and your choice.",0
Thank you Shane. This helped me so fucking much. Thank you,0
even if you are gay I still support you.,1
"John 3:16<br>“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”",1
"I absolutely LOVE YOU SHANE!!!!! I’ve been watching your Channel for awhile now, and am so glad I came across this video. Even though it was 6 years ago, this video is amazing, and I just love how you said do it and told the world exactly how you feel and what it is and who the fuck you are whether you knew it or not! You’re just an amazing, AMAZING SOUL 🤍 Wish I knew you in person 🥺 Love you to pieces 🥰😘🤍 Xoxo 💋",0
"I appreciate this video as someone who is bi. I never watched your channel, but I love this and even after 6 yrs it’s lasted where ppl like me need it. So thank you &lt;3",0
I have honestly never been so related to what your saying Shane literally 💖 thank you💖🦋,0
You have my super luv &lt;3,0
I not rude or anything but I don&#39;t like gays,1
trisexual. Men women and cats haha,1
sometimes when things get hard I always come back to this video. thank you for helping me be comfortable with my sexuality. forever looking up to you and how you were and are never afraid to be who you are &lt;3,0
"The world should be open-minded.. Tell you a little secret, we&#39;re all bisexual.. And we all went through a phase younger trying to find ourselves and our sexuallity.. Our minds are what are attracted to people.. It&#39;s what you make your mind get used to. God is love.. And he loves that you love people... Just stay true to you Shane.",1
You remind me of an x of mine. We are like 50 now. I think of how he would have been great at what you&#39;re doing but instead he got bullied to the point he barely left the house for his gayness. We had a blast just hanging out at his moms. I&#39;m so glad we are past all that in society today.,0
"I&#39;m so so sorry your families religious beliefs made you feel that way shane, you&#39;re amazing you YOU SIR SHANE YAW yes I&#39;m using your given name because YOU are absolutely 💯 % A M A Z I N G! I hope you genuinely know how much you have helped so so many <a href=""http://people.im/"">people.im</a> so happy you&#39;re your true self and happy with Ryland. He is the other have of your coin.",0
So proud of u shane sometimes i think im bi too but i dont know honestly,0
you should never be ashamed,0
"I am so glad your not doing YouTube anymore. LGBTQ is fine but after what you did, you don&#39;t deserve your fans. They are above you. So many children look up to you, not knowing how many bad things you have done",0
Just focus on youtube. Keep your personal issue to your self.,0
I love this song sm,0

Hey what’s up you guys yes,0
It&#39;s ok... people should judge by soul and not sexuality,0

!!!!!!!!!!HII FROM 2021!!!!!!!!!!,0
Uh oh no child is safe,0
"Okay, really late to this Shane party. Its 2021 for fucksakes why am I just discovering how AWESOMELY TALENTED you are?? I believeyour sexuality is YOURS. You dont have any obligation to make excuses or justifications to anyone, but yourself. As long as its consensual with all parties involved that is) Anyone who judges you for your sexual preference isnt deserving of being in your life anyway. IMO, people like that can be their idea of &quot;sexually perfect&quot; by going &amp; fucking themselves til the end of time.<br><br>Anyway, I hope your still creating content because DAMN dude you are funny AF &amp; so talented. Ive read the many comments saying how happy you are &amp; hope it continues for you.THANKS for starting my day on a positive note!! Take Care, be YOU &amp; FUCK ANYBODY THAT THINKS OTHERWISE.💜",0

I’ve watched this video so many times over the past 6 years. It’s not because I’m bi or gay. It’s because I LOVE seeing Shane be so real and open. I’ve been a fan since I was a kid and I miss him so much..,0
no one cares,0
Please don&#39;t fuck your cat,0
gay lol,1
We all know 👁👄👁,0
Nobody:<br>Not a single soul:<br>Me watching this in 2021,0
I’m looking for the comment on twitter 💀,0
Shane&#39;s the reason why I came out as bisexual. I owe everything to him because this video described everything I was thinking about myself. I repressed my feelings for years and I finally came out officially to myself and others this year. Thanks Shane for everything.,0
"It&#39;s 2021 and I&#39;m watching this... Welp, I don&#39;t know how my life arrived here but I have no regrets.",0
His teddy bear shirt omg it’s so cute 😭,0
Thank you Shane! We love you.,0
"Coming out was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done. A year ago yesterday I was out to my “best friend” at the time (who after a couple weeks turned out to be my girlfriend) and she asked me if I liked anyone and I froze and kept giving off subtle hints that it was her and when she finally realized she hugged me and then took both my hands, pushed my hair behind my face and told me she loved me. Then we were holding hands every time we saw each other and we started cuddling but we weren’t official yet. After a couple weeks I didn’t care if it ruined our friendship and I asked her out. She was so excited and she said she’d love to be mine and it was great. We had our first kiss three weeks after we got together. Then my homophobic mother found out after I accidentally came out to my teacher and threatened to separate us. I cried for three days straight and even went down the terrible road of SH. I told her I couldn’t just be friends with her and that I actually loved her so so much. We decided to do anything we could to fight to be together after she found out I loved her. It was tough to hide things at first, but we eventually got really good at jumping off each other then cuddling and kissing after people left the room for 5 minutes. I was heavily sexualized even though I’m very young and my mom’s side of the family always assumed I would be the “weird” one and throw myself onto my girlfriend at the time. I never told them but they found out somehow. It was so draining to just not even be able to sit next to someone I love so much. We weren’t even allowed to hug around my moms side of the family. I loved and admired this girl so so much and I still to this day do. I don’t really want to get into all the details but we got into a little fight and she’s being forced to stay away from me because I apparently was taking her away from her family according to her parents which I don’t know how that can be possible if they always did whatever they could to get rid of her for as long as possible and they let us take her everywhere with us. It was almost like an unofficial custody thing. We got her on weekends and when things were tough in her home. But now I miss her more than life and she still talks to me in person. I know she misses me too just by the way she acts around me and my family. She’s just not allowed to have any contact outside of in public.",0
Little did 10 year old me watching this know that I was pan<br>Damn man life hits like<br>a bag a rock being chucked down a flight of stairs aimed for my head,0
"Man, you&#39;re gay from the start, everyone knew.",1

"Hang ib there Shawn! It is more important than anything to truly listen to what you really want. Regardless of what the world might say or make you think, that is the Key",0
"I’m not ever, going to tell my children.. that they can’t do.. or love.. who they need to love… ever… I love you Shane ❤️ I know this video is old but.. still ❤️",0
"My son is in his 30&#39;s and is still trying to find out who he is yet. I really wish you didn&#39;t have to go through a bunch of this stuff. I also wish that society today wasn&#39;t so toxic towards people. <br>I know you are loved, you have an amazing opportunity to embrace your life &amp; the amazing talent, creativity that&#39;s inside you.<br>Plus it was in the 70&#39;s I came out as bisexual because I was tired of the stigma so many put up with because of narrow-mindedness. I embraced it!<br>I used to joke that I had more options for a date on Friday night.<br><br>Now, I&#39;m older... 60 is not far off. I&#39;m not interested any longer in the physical aspect. Companionship is the heart of love. The physical is a nice bonus... but the heart knows what it wants. Trust it.<br>Also, glad you found someone who makes you the best you that you can be. That&#39;s important. Someone who not only stands beside you, but also stands up for you. Someone who&#39;s there for you, loves you &amp; challenges you. Someone who&#39;ll find ways to help you reach goals together.<br><br>I only wish you could reclaim the confidence, purpose &amp; the &#39;in the zone&#39; passion you did while working on the pallet &amp; documentary. You had a strong vibe of energy. The confidence was in your walk, your smile, the way you were on target when you were filming. That documentary, &amp; the JS one were phenomenal! Loved the editing work, the tracks, totally high-end work.<br>Don&#39;t keep such talent hidden away - share it with the world!<br>We need a more positive, better world, better angels view to fight the negativity, hate &amp; toxic poison in today&#39;s society. I think you could do it - you could show the contrast of how things have gotten f&#39;d up &amp; how we can make it better.<br><br>No matter how toxic things have been - your music has still helped to heal - Maybe This Christmas. Your music has still touched people and made them feel better - SuperLuv. You need to embrace the good you did, the positive things &amp; be proud of them. (People are still listening to those songs... I&#39;ve checked, they are still enjoying them. Tons want a remake with Ryland as the girl &amp; a number of others came up as the bullies. But the positives are in the thousands for it. You&#39;ve still Singing Shane fans who want more music from you. Go figure!)<br><br>Take care, stay safe out there... live your best life, &#39;cause it&#39;s the only one you&#39;ve got. Be a shooting star or a lazy river... but make sure the choice makes you happy.",0

It hasn&#39;t been the same with him for the past few years and especially with all the youtube drama and the apologies.

Why not have a threesome it’s always good if your bisexual. Then you can have both at the same time and have any man and woman you like. I am not gay or bisexual totally heterosexual so I prefer only one woman . I will never be gay or bisexual. I’m pretty sure I am happy that way.,1

Nobody:<br>YouTube: here’s a 5 year old video of Shane coming out,0
"Do not set a label on yourself, you are Just a person with a really open MIND mind and full with love.",0
No wonder you sounds exactly like Florian in GTA4,0

Wow really I am to 😌,0
Not me watching this in November of 2020,0
where did he get that bear t-shirt/sweatshirt? I wanna get it :),0
"I&#39;m really confused about my sexuality. <br><br>Ever since 6th grade, I&#39;ve been made fun of for doing something that could&#39;ve been considered gay. I wore another guy&#39;s coat because I was freezing in the rain on a school trip. I don&#39;t understand why but it&#39;s made me so confused and made me question my own sexuality. It&#39;s just fucked with my brain so badly that I don&#39;t know what I am right now. <br><br>I know it may sound silly or stupid but I really don&#39;t know. I know I like girls but every so often, I get thoughts about guys and I have no idea what is happening to me.",0
The clicking of the tongue ugh. <br>Love U Shane though x,0
Thank you sooo much for making this video it really helpful thank you never stop making videos love you 😊,0
I feel embarrassed watching a man say this,0
I HATE bisexuals,1
Shane may think this video sucks. But Shane u have helped so many fucking people come out as LGBTQ+. Including me as bisexual. I think Shane dosnt knows how much he’s helped people whenever he does come back he will have tons of people behind him. Including me Shane if ur reading the I MOTHER FUCKING LOVE YOU SHANE. and don’t forget YOUR SHANE FUCKING DAWSON!!!!!,0
I love you so much shane and you are the most amazing person EVER!!!!! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 You desverse the hole world!,0

We support you Shane. No matter what. I&#39;m bisexual to,0
I though your name was shane,0
"Wow, hes a part of our community yet transphobic",0
Lisa what the fuck did you do to him,0
"I always knew it, I’m bi too btw also I just found out through another video and I looked this up to confirm it, I was an early fan in 2009 but i lost track of your new videos and basically I missed this one lol ✌🏼❤️",0
"I love u Shane, please know that we still stand by you, ur going through a hard time and we’re here with full support❤️❤️❤️",0
I still love you Shane. I don&#39;t believe I commented on your videos but I am now. Not Cool is still my favorite movie. I watched it yesterday and I realized how much I used to love it (and still do). I can&#39;t wait for you to come back,0
I&#39;m bi but I haven&#39;t told my parents but I have told everybody else because I&#39;m just too scared to because they are very religious and I&#39;m just not as religious as they are,0

Everyone still loves you Shane 😀😀😀,0

I love you Shane,0
So the drama and shit that&#39;s going on fuck that I don&#39;t want anything to do with it I don&#39;t care and I&#39;ll always love shane he&#39;s loving and I love going back to these videos before shit went down<br><br>Edit: You have to see past the imperfections to see someone&#39;s true self Shane is a great example he might joke about his insecurities and joke that Ryland is going to leave him he&#39;s telling us information through comedy just bc he has a lot of money does not make him better than us and he knows that he likes drama and we all do for the most part but people say he&#39;s begging etc or whatever this comment has no point other than to open your eyes a little wider and look into what people have been through it doesn&#39;t excuse their actions but it helps us grow into better people,0
im confused. I need help :(,0
WoW racist playing the sympathy card over here.,0

❤💜💙,0
Who’s watching this is September 2020. When the Shane drama died down?!?,0
Hello from August 2020,0
Did anyone else this he was gay this whole time (I’m pan) LOVE YOU SHANE,0
That&#39;s is ok man and nothing will take that from me watching your video,0
Gay actually. Nice try Dawson.,1
We don&#39;t claim you in our community now that we&#39;ve found out what you did :),0
this is such a rare and beautiful video!!  thank you,0
no wonder he made zepeto..,0
lub u,0
And here we are 5 years later dating Ryland,0
hes gay. thats why it never works with women for him lol.,1
"i honestly think that if shane hasn&#39;t already changed, we should still give him a chance. those video were so long ago, and the videos he made with his actual friends (garrett, drew, andrew, morgan, etc) we&#39;re completely fine and he seemed like he&#39;d genuinely changed. (up until the documentary videos, at least.) forgive, but don&#39;t forget is basically what i&#39;m saying.",0
Was this before he started dating Ryland?,0
15 mins of Shane doing ASMR,0
pov: u don&#39;t care if ppl are here after he got canceled or if they&#39;re in quarantine yet u still see comments saying that,0

"“Homosexual persons are called to chastity. By the virtues of self-mastery that teach them inner freedom, at times by the support of disinterested friendship, by prayer and sacramental grace, they can and should gradually and resolutely approach Christian perfection.” – Catechism of the Catholic Church, 3359.",1
I guess Shane was too dumb to realize that getting fat is the least effective way to become invisible,0
Hope you’re  happy,0
Watch Amazing Atheist&#39;s &quot;I&#39;m Bisexualer&quot;,0
bisexuality doesnt include children shane ✨🧚‍♂️💫🦋💮,0
we been knew sis💅🏻,0
🤗😍,0
I think whatever the abuse was that Shane endured when he was young really messed up his head! He has to be very careful because the abused are statistically more often to become abusers! That is why these constant “jokes” about pedophilia may be deeply held issues that he doesn’t realize are not okay! I hope he gets SERIOUS mental health treatment and a life coach! I honestly wish him hope and healing!!,0
Watching after Shane starts reuploading his videos,0
Love you shane your awesome,0
bruh if ur gay it doesn&#39;t mean ur not ever confused either lol,0
He looked so much more handsome. 😢,0
Racist,0
To all you pussys being too scared to say they&#39;re gay NOBODY GIVES A FUCK as a gay I know for a fact nobody is gonna judge you and if they do there fucked is the head. Same goes for bisexual btw,0
This is one of the many things me and Shane relate too!,0
Idk why this made me jump I guess I was just suprised but it&#39;s fine that your bi 🙂 I still respect you,0
Like if being gay is straight up gay,0
We will love you forever😘😍😍😘😍😍😘😘😍😘,0
"I really need to say thank you😭😭<br>You have helped me through SOO much,I have recently come out and have been spending less time in my room in the dark,you always put I smile on my face<br><br>     I FUCKING LOVE YOU!!😭❤️❤️😭😭❤️❤️😭❤️😭",0

Who’s watching this now and still supporting Shane Dawson ?,0
"Shane, God Bless your heart. I&#39;m sorry you were so uncomfortable with who you are and allowing yourself to accept it. You should never be ashamed of how you feel or who you are inside or out. And, let me say that God does accept you. Don&#39;t let that bother you.",0
And now your engaged to a guy so I mean you could have said that 🤔,0
And now he’s engaged and losing his career I mean I hope not cuz he’s amazing but it seems that way 🤷🏻‍♀️,0
"Shane, you&#39;re attracted to the heart, I think you&#39;re pan, gender doesn&#39;t matter.",0
It&#39;s so funny when children are replying to every recent hate comment on this video,0

why are you gae ?,0
A racist bisexual,0
Am I the only one who is watching this in July 2020,0
Haha gayy,1
Why not have a threesome it’s always good if your bisexual. Then you can have both at the same time and have any man and woman you like. I am not gay or bisexual totally heterosexual so I prefer only one woman . I will never be gay or bisexual. I’m pretty sure I am happy that way.,1
Almost 5 years :’),0
I was today years old when I found out he wasn’t always gay,0
the fact that he was in the closet while he basically outed dan and phil is just ugh,0
2020 anyone???,0
I’m so sorry about everything your going through right now you made me laugh and we’re always there for me when I needed someone I love you it will get better ❤️,0
Can someone explain what happened with Shane and why people are being mean to him?,0
HE DELETED ALL HIW VIDEOS DNDHHDJR,0
Wtf...,0
he’s bisexual. he likes women and men. stop telling him to pick one of them.,0
who’s here after he deleted all his old videos and the only ones left are the lottery and this 😆,0
"My mind is telling me no,<br>BUT MY BODY,<br>MY BODYS TELLING ME YESS",0
"Aww poor Shane, don’t be sad we all love you",0
who is here to end this man’s career?,0
almost five years later. damn shane.,0
"Shane.. dunno if youll get this. I realise things are spiralling and you feel cornered<br> I realise what edgy humor you were trying.. it was fine.. now its not. I still love you. Still support you. 💜 keep yourself safe. Mentally, physically, spiritually. Take time. Step away.",0
I love you Shane❤️,0
this should b titled I’m a<br>nonce,0
shanee i was rooting for uu bitchhh. u got urself into so much dramaaa. i miss the unproblematic you. 😭😭,0
HE DELETED ALL HIS VIDEOS NOOO OMG,0
Just the 2 videos left. Damn. Use to come here for pick me ups after a long hard day. All gone. No more humor. Sad,0
I miss your older type of content. It’s a shame people are too sensitive for it now,0
4 years later he’s getting cancelled 🤭🥵,0
who’s here after his dumbass got cancelled😼,0
Who is here after he deleted almost all his vids,0
shane it is okay my sister is bi well that is what shane says,0
I love you shane ❤,0
I remember being done with men when I told a boy he was cute and he told the teacher on me in second grade.,0
Who is here after the incident?,0
Cancel Culture is alive and real and it&#39;s taking Shane down 👎🏽,0
"I&#39;ve decided to spam this message so there&#39;s a chance he&#39;ll see it.<br><br>I miss you so much Shane. I&#39;m so disappointed right now. I feel like I understand why you had you&#39;re humor and when I started watching I was 12 and suicidal. I had just started self harming literally and then found you. I&#39;m disappointed and obviously the jokes weren&#39;t okay but I made it because of you, well and myself. Now it&#39;s my child who&#39;s been why I&#39;m alive but you&#39;re the reason I made it through my teen years. I love you Shane Dawson. Be better please. I believe in you and this is so messy. I hope the best for you. This also made me smile a lot when it first came out. I watched your struggle for so long. I came out at around 12/13 as bisexual and I got a lot of shit from friends so this was amazing to see. I was hoping if I commented on a older video there was no new comments on that you might see this. I literally have been trying to get your attention since I started watching. I&#39;ll be 23 soon so this is my last attempt. You gotta know deep down inside how yo fix this. Whatever roll you played.",0
Who here cuz he deleted all of his old vids?,0
🥺,0
i miss you shane.,0
here july 2020 and damn everything is going downhill,0
can’t believe you deleted your offensive and triggering content after you lost monetization on your videos. you should’ve done this shit ages ago. too late shane.,0
We support you ❤,0
Wow only two videos left on this channel,0
So I just come on here and they deleted practically all of his goddamn videos. Whatever happened to freedom of speech? This is getting very scary this is like Russia or something. Put every damn video Back on YouTube if you don&#39;t like him don&#39;t watch this is taking away our freedom. People are freaking out about their freedom being taken away about having to wear masks during a pandemic which is disgusting but now this is a serious infringement. He apologized a lot of comedians make crazy jokes and just because Patty went on there to say some gossip about James Charles and her not feeling supported and all this nonsense they&#39;re going to go ahead and just cancel. I want these videos back. YouTube is disgusting for doing this and as a matter of fact I hope he finds a different format. Maybe Netflix. YouTube is below Shane and they should be ashamed he made a fortune for everyone,0
yeet,0
Don’t feel sorry for him,0
I’m here for no reasons.... i’m just here whenever i feel confused...,0
shane literally deleted all his videos,0
You were part of my childhood! I can’t believe you deleted your old videos!!!! I just remembered you (because all the current drama) so sad...just wanted to revisit it,0
Ofc he left this one up cause he thinks a video of him coming out and talking about being sexually abused will soften the blow,0
I&#39;m still confused about myself,0
F this dude lol,0
Who came to see what he deleted?,0
Youre done son,0
Your alsooo racist,0
mans deleted EVERYTHING?,0
Ok I was bi but now I’m a full lesbian,0
Bro I didn’t think he deleted all his videos,0
Watching in June 2020,0
"i wish he didnt have this whole &quot;im depressed and anxious i hate myself more than any of you&quot; vibe about him because im disgusted by his actions and content over the last few years being overhyped and sloppy at best but part of me still feels bad for him despite never really being a fan. idk i hope he just takes accountability for once i dont want him to do anything irrational or stupid just... acknowledge all of the shit you did this time. if it makes you uncomfortable, imagine how to people who looked up to you feel right now, especially with your silence",0
"Depression and anxiety isn’t an excuse to sexualize children, Shane.",0
Anyone watching cuz of how bad he got cancelled?,0
and to think that back then he was a pedo..😳,0
Epic,0
June 2020 anyone,0
He deleted everything but 2 videos?? Damn..,0
"I love u shane, u still have a lot of fans that care about you, dont read hate comments and dont let them get to u.<br>also there is a reply i found i thought needed more attention &lt;3 no hate :)<br><br>the reply: <br><br>here’s the thing. He screws up, everyone demands that he addresses it. He addresses it, everyone demands an apology.  He apologizes, everyone says it’s not sincere and that he only apologized for getting caught.  People demand he hides the videos because theyre offensive. He hides them, and everyone says he’s trying to hide evidence. I won’t lie that Shane used to have bad taste in humor, but that was 10 years ago, and he has changed since then. A lot of these people could literally not even be please if Shane disappeared forever, and that really irks me because at this point the just want to be mad.  Ignoring a decade of growth in someone just so you can cancel them is kind of dumb.",0
all these positive comments didnt age well😂,0
Now you’re cancelled you weirdo,0
Love you Shane.,0
You know a cids old of its in your recommended section,0
Ok what&#39;s going on,0
💖Anyone here after hes been called out for the gross person he is✨,0
He deleted all his offensive videos which should have been done the first time he apologized lol.,0
In the mighty name of jesus may you   become straight,0
Ryland has entered the chat,0
Who was trying to find vids from Shane years ago from drama alert then post it on Twitter lol,0
Who’s watching this after he’s been cancelled in 2020,0
Geiii,0
You say how hard it is to come out yet sexualised and tried to out dan and Phil multiple times ?,0
who’s watching this after he deleted this whole account-,0
"You know.. i think im bisexual too. but im Christian, and i don&#39;t wanna except it...",1
"please unprivate the rest of your old videos, they were so fucking funny, ugh.",0
"Awww man, I wanted to watch Shanaynays Christmas, but it is gone. 😭",0

"Damn* the quality was so bad back then, and the fact that it was 2015!",0
Gay boy,1
Who else got the presidential campaign ad?,0
This must be hard for you to get accepted<br><br>BECAUSE I BET THIS COMMUNITY HATES YOU,0
"I have been struggling for the past years of my life figuring out if im bi or not, I am scared and unsure I dont want to go to hell either but was I born like this or not I have so many questions and I wanna get to the bottom of it soon because I dont wanna live and realize im bi by the age of 50",1
How come he didn’t leave the short film it gets worse,0
who’s here after the videos he deleted,0
Yeah you are also a racist and perverted dude 🌚,0
"Dont know what side to take.....on one hand, what he did in his past was not ok and should have never happened. But on the other hand, the videos of him that are coming out, are over 5 years ago and bringing up something from the past to make Shane look bad (even though he has changed) is also not ok. It&#39;s hard to see Shane go through this. But the person reading this comment.....just know....nobody is perfect. Of course the things he did 6+ years ago are completely unforgivable, but I feel like people saying &quot;put shane in prison&quot; is too far. And I dont think I&#39;m the only one asking this when I say &quot;how come just now these videos are being brought up?&quot;. But on an end note, nobody is perfect and I choose to stay nuteral......",0
Really? You clear your old account that got you to where you are and leave a few? Pathetic. Hiding your past isn’t gonna help anything.,0
nobody:<br>literally not a soul:<br>you: coming to this channel after seeing he deleted all of his content and reading this comment,0
Whos here when  he got Exposed?,0
U are gay...,1
Damn. One of two videos left. Ouch.<br><br>More are public again. Awesome!,0
This is one of two videos left on his channel now because of all the controversies in the past few days. It’s so sad to see it all gone but it’s for the best. I hope Shane is okay and survived through all of this 💓,0
Your looking at this video during the drama with Shane,0
damn thats pretty gay,0
goodbye,0
Who watching when he’s getting cancelled In quarantine,0
I love you,0
Don’t worry past Shane. You meet an amazing queen named ryland and you are going to get married!!! You will be OK,0
Well,0
He put it back🥺 thank you Shane.,0
Your a perv now ...,0
We can marry freely why the fuck do we demand more?,1
I think we should stop using the rainbow as money scam and just be us and support ourselves without forcing others to get on page. We are based on equality and all the rainbow has done is demand this and that based on money and not rights. I’m so ashamed of what people in charge have bullshited represented our rainbow to be. Enough is a fucking enough.,1
Who’s watching this while all the scandals about Shane? I still love Shane and I really hope it gets better,0
This is the Shane I know being himself not this weird I’m to sensitive with Jeffree I WANT SHANE BACK NOT SHANE DAWSON,0

"Ephesians 5:5 For be sure of this: that no person practicing sexual vice or impurity in thought or in life, or one who is covetous [who has lustful desire for the property of others and is greedy for gain]–for he [in effect] is an idolater–has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.",1
"Sooo, a bunch of strange people. <br>Like there was something wrong with man and female.",1
This made me cry,0
All I have to say is thank you. I know the confusion and the stress of being bi. You may never see this comment but thank you for helping me not feel alone.,0

"So, what are Kat Moening&#39;s thoughts on the movement to make lesbian defined as &quot;a woman who&#39;s attracted to women regardless of biological sex?&quot; Just a hunch, but I can&#39;t help but feel that most of the persons featured here believe that you aren&#39;t a real lesbian unless you&#39;re a woman who eats tacos and rides the GD train.",1
literally is making me sob. my entire family is religious and it’s always been a terrifying thought to think about how they’d react.,0
But I love you,0
Umm 🤔  it’s June 2020. And I am now finding this ........Jesus,0
Nobody <br>Nobody at all<br>Not a single soul <br>Everybody saying nobody lmfao,0
Watching this video got me to gain the courage to come out as bisexual and now I’m with the girl of my dreams 🥰🥰,0
I came out as bi last year and I kinda knew that I was never straight because it never felt right for me so fast forward to about a week after I knew I realized that I had a hug and I mean HUGEE crush on my best friend and my idiot self kissed her out of no where (were still best friends to this day we just dont talk about that awkward kiss) I haven&#39;t really came out to anyone (my mum doesn&#39;t believe me and my dads side of the family r homophobic 😬) so uh yeah thats me coming out 😂,0
"I remember watching this just weeks after coming out as Bi, this video of Shane coming out made me feel confident that I did the right thing. Hope ya see this Shane, I can tell you are so much happier since coming out, I have been too since I came out, Also one more thing, your conspiracy vids are my favorites from the new series.",0
"I&#39;m also bisexual, have no qualms in saying it out loud, so no worries. Back in the day any guy would see this and say &quot;well, don&#39;t you dare hit on me now&quot;.<br>Nowadays, because everyone wants to be &quot;inclusive&quot;, they either clap for it, or simply accept it, no questions asked.<br><br><br>Or they hit on me, which is also weird XD.",0
2020 anyone? 👀,0

"I know I’m 5 years late, but I’m just wanna say that I’m so proud of Shane and how far he’s come and also that I’ve been really struggling with my sexuality a lot recently and that this really helped and I’m so thankful he made this video (seeing this actually made me cry)💜💛",0
Quarantine has brought me back to this,0
"I never saw this video when it first came out because I don&#39;t know why to be honest. I just saw the thumbnail and was &quot;Oh okay, guess he&#39;s bi makes sense I guess&quot; but it&#39;s sad to see it now and how sad he was all these years because he couldn&#39;t accept or didn&#39;t know who he was. It&#39;s crazy now that he&#39;s doing great and I hope for the best for Shane because he&#39;s been a great part of my childhood. And yes it&#39;s pretty fucked up that I watched his older videos when I was a kid but who else didn&#39;t?",0
He was so sad that he would not find love but now he is engaged with ryland!,0
ok,0
AH,0
Shame we all support you and you helped me to find out that I am also bisexual!,0
"I&#39;m watching this at age 12.... I just realized that I am a bisexual and I cant tell anybody, but none if my friends will be reading this so it should be ok. Umm... if anybody else has come out, any tips maybe? I&#39;m literally terrified",0
2020 anybody,0
we love you and you helped me come out as bi too...never EVER change who you are you are a queen&lt;3,0
I will love Shane for the rest of my life and beyond my death,0
My son is bisexual. His Dad and I adore him.  He is an amazing person. The way he tells it is he falls in love with people. Xx,0
My lesbian demigirl ass <br><br><br><br>I LOVE COMING OUT VIDEOS,0
I am bisexual and I came out to my friends about a year and a half ago. It was one of the best moments of my life. They were all so excepting and supportive. It felt like a weight being lifted off my shoulders. I am really scared to come out to my family because I don’t know how there going to react. Does anyone have any advice on telling them? that would really help.❤️,0
The bio says everything❤️,0
"I&#39;ve recently found out that I&#39;m bisexual, even though I was when I was 11 and 12, I still struggle with my sexuality, I&#39;ve always been so confused, but I found out who I really am, I know how you feel.",0
don&#39;t be sad i am too,0
"Shane you helped me realize I&#39;m bisexual too... Thank you! I truly love you and your videos, they keep me having a will to not stop and not give up. Thank you. You really are awesome 💜💜",0
I’m so confused because I legit thought this happened like before 2010 from what I remember??,0
As a bisexual person - I&#39;m very touched by this video! I&#39;ve had so many issues with driving myself crazy with labels and trying to figure out if I&#39;m kidding myself or what. This video really just goes to show that it&#39;s a universal experience and that it&#39;s ok to just put those labels aside and just say &quot;I love people&quot;. Full stop!<br>Thank you Shane!,0
UR A RACIST BLACK FACE,0
"no one:<br><br>me: watching this mid-may of 2020...<br><br><br>also can we talk about how he said &quot;idk who im going to end up with&quot;, AND HE&#39;S LITERALLY ENGAGED NOW",0
this still helps in 2020 btw. thank you,0
Look at where you are today Shane &lt;3 Ryland was meant for you &lt;3 !!!!!!!!!!,0
Who’s bingeing Shane during the covid 19 pandemic 😅,0
When I was a kid I was straight until I turned 20 and found girls more attractive and thought guys were ugly even myself,0

"I know I’m so late to this and you probably won’t see this but I wanna say i know how you feel cuz I’ve been there and if you don’t like labels,well to bad cuz  I’m labeling you as human  just like Ryland and Garett. Love ya and keep up all of your great work and content😊",0

James Charles entered the chat,0
Dude it&#39;s ok to be gay,0
"I believe that all people r &#39;bisexual&#39;, the reason people take sides is because Exclusively &#39;Gay&#39; people can not hide from the discrimination, while people who identify as &#39;heterosexual&#39; r too afraid of not fitting in (being acceptable to the norm) to challenge their fear of intimacy with others.<br><br>In my world what is attractive to me about another person is how comfortable they r where in the same situation I am not, hence being with people who r more comfortable in them selves then I am in the same situation,  teaches me to become comfortable like them.",0
It’s ok Shane  u can be wat u wanna be  leap up the good work,0

What is the scientific underpinning for this very concept? It seems that these people are just deeply confused and need to figure themselve out (perhaps with a psychologist).,1

What&#39;s a queer crush? Isn&#39;t that just a crush?,0
We can marry freely why the fuck do we demand more?,1
I think we should stop using the rainbow as money scam and just be us and support ourselves without forcing others to get on page. We are based on equality and all the rainbow has done is demand this and that based on money and not rights. I’m so ashamed of what people in charge have bullshited represented our rainbow to be. Enough is a fucking enough.,1
I&#39;m not a queer person but I love the queer community. It&#39;s lovely to see all the different types of people.,0

Awesome i love this video!😊☺😊,0
This is an awesome and absolutely beautiful kind of video. Giving my respect to them and to other people who are part of these communities. I also agree that “Chosen family are the people that know you and love you for exactly who you are.”,0

"I’m an internal butch but external total femme and my wife is a soft butch but internal EXTREME femme. Like, if we had a flat, I would be changing the tire, with my hair that’s down to my butt, healed boots, a dress and red lipstick. Which I have before. While she sat in the car with her butch haircut, short nails, flannel shirt and LL bean boots on 🤣 I’m fire, she’s ice. She’s a pushover with the kids, I’m the lay down the law. And when it comes to top and bottom, we’re switch hitters all the way. We’re just weirdos, walking contradictions, books with deceiving covers, which is why we work so well together 😂 We’ve been together 11 years, she’s 11 years older than me because I’ve always been older than my years (I’ve literally lived on my own since 16 as an emancipated minor, graduated high school at 16, got my first college degree at 18, and owned my first home at 19, and at 42, recently officially retired from a very successful career with a great pension) and without a doubt the love of my life. The age difference freaked her out when we first met. But the more she got to know me, the more she discovered she’s younger than me in a lot of ways actually. I feel ancient. Like I’ve lived several lifetimes. But I’ve always had much more in common with people older than me compared with those in my own age group who, at no fault of their own, seemed extremely immature and naive just because I was so advanced for my age. I’ve only ever been with someone younger one time. A longggg time ago too. And that was only by 3 years 😂 So we are strange us human beings. There is no wrong or right when it comes to being in LGBTQ spectrum. I’ve had relationships before where I was harshly judged because I didn’t fit the “femme” stereotype. And it used to hurt me a lot. And then I figured out it’s not a me problem. We just weren’t the right people for each other. And maybe they were afraid of who I was, because they weren’t comfortable enough in who they were and feeling insecure. But there was nothing wrong with me. So, If it feels natural and right to you, just be you. Because you are the only one who can. And please believe, there is someone out there who will LOVE the you you are, and fit perfectly with you precisely because you are you. So let your freak flag fly, embrace your weirdness, and never be afraid of rocking that out. And if the person you’re with doesn’t appreciate that, they aren’t the right person for you. Wishing you all ♥️, ☮️, and happiness.",0

"There is once from a million other times again that there is no ace and/or aro representation in the LGBTQ community. For the question of who was your crush, I had none. For the question of who is your queer icon, I do have a few (ex. Billie Joe Armstrong from Green Day) but not any who represent my identity. There haven’t really been any ace/aro icons, so I must become that for myself and others.<br>EDIT: There actually is an aro-ace activist that I connect myself to, she’s not a mainstream icon, but her name is Yasmin Benoit. She is a dark alternative and lingerie model, in addition to aro-ace activist and Youtuber.",0

God created us to have a relationship with him, only through Jesus can we be reunited with him.",0

What is this,0
&quot;non binary trans masculine individual&quot;. What does it mean ?,0
So obsessed with gender identities...,1
So what I’ve taken is that there’s a disconnect within the lgbtq+ community. Frankly I don’t think the younger generation accepts the older ones and the older ones are so used to their way of life that the younger ones are “too much” or something for them.,0

leisha and kate :D,0
I love the term queer :) to me it just means I’m not straight. I guess I’m technically pansexual but I also feel very fluid in my gender as well as my sexuality and I may be somewhere on the ace spectrum. To me I haven’t totally been able to decide on these labels but I don’t feel a need for labels or categorizing myself. I like queer because I can convey that I’m not straight but I don’t have to give details about my sex life or gender or whatever. I just like who I like. I just am.,0

"Our unity shouldn&#39;t be about RACE, AGE, CULTURE, RELIGION, OR WHAT ONE CALLS THEMSELVES, we are all part of the same group/family, QUEER! And as women, especially, we NEED to unite, because just like straight women, we queer women are pushed aside often, but by not only straight men, but gay men too! <br>I mean this the new L Word series, will I believe be the first series to have a cast member who is a Tran man, we have seen plenty of Trans females, but few Trans males in film or TV! <br>Though I am not blaming Trans women for that, it&#39;s a media thing, men always get more attention, even when they are no longer a man! <br>But really, all  QUEER people need to unite, whether male, female or neither, no matter what you identify as, we should all be on each others side, not just one or the other! <br>But, unfortunately, men, well gay and straight men, have little to no respect or concern for us women, whether we&#39;re gay, trans, bi or straight or anything else, if your female or identify as female, your suddenly less the human, because your not male! <br>Remember women up until the 1900&#39;s were seen all over the world, including here in the US, as the same as live stock, just the way African slaves were seen here in the US, ALL women were seen as NOT really the same level of human as men were! Oh they didn&#39;t seem to know what to call us exactly, but, scientists had us down in books and on documents back in those days, as being like things for men to buy or acquire, men were supposed to get a job, and then a wife, to have offspring with, but it was like we were LITERALLY BABY MAKING MACHINES for the men to buy in someway or another or sell, if they were the women&#39;s father, if there was no father, then brother, if no males, then maybe mother, but maybe they then just took them! <br>It wasn&#39;t always actual money of course, sometimes we were just talking image, and sometimes the men weren&#39;t the rich ones, so they were the ones getting rich by marrying the woman! <br>And as we all know, in some countries today, things aren&#39;t any different then they were a 100 years ago elsewhere! <br><br><br>And most don&#39;t realize that when it comes to gay people, gay women/Lesbians, were not the one&#39;s being arrested in places like in Europe or even the US, it was mostly men, because anal sex/sodomi was a crime, NOT so much two men kissing or anything else they might do! Which means if gay men weren&#39;t known to have sex that way, seeing them kissing, wouldn&#39;t have gotten them in any trouble in most places! <br><br><br>Of course it&#39;s mostly a crime because of religion, Judaism, Christianity and Islam all have it as a sin, but nothing about kissing another man if your a man or another woman if your a woman, at least not until later when the words homesexual was added in some books of those religions!",1

"I feel as though a lot of time bisexuality isn&#39;t really accepted in the LGBTQ+ community. I am a lesbian woman but I have seen and heard all the time, that gay women do not want to date bisexual women because they don&#39;t think that bisexual women are for real or would take them seriously. I think that is so wrong. I dated a bisexual woman and although I&#39;m not together with her anymore I would probably say she was the most loyal and loving partner I&#39;ve had. I dated a gay woman and she cheated on me so.  I see many Tinder profiles that say, &quot;if you are bisexual, don&#39;t swipe right.&quot; We are supposed to be the most open and inclusive to all people, yet we are doing the very same thing that we have tried to escape from our whole lives. We of all people should understand. The bi-phobia needs to stop.",0

WAKE UP.. I am I liberal for the most part and a combat medic and veteran of this country.. I spoke with an E6 staff Sgt today and he even agreed the direction we are going is extremely dangerous and we need to WAKE UP TO REALITY.... SO WAKE UP and stop believing the lies PLEASE people!!,1

So the SJWs got offeneded by people saying they where super straight and saying it wasnt a sexuality... because blah blah homophoia blah blah transphoia blah blah.  Yet these same peeople have never ever critisted a single queer person.  And apprently queer is not wnating a label for sexuality or/and gender.,1
So if someone doesnt identify with any label including queer are they hyper queer.  4 Billion years of evolution and we somehow ended up at this.,1

There&#39;s nothing special about being queer and nothing special about being straight either. I&#39;m gay and it&#39;s never been a big deal to me because it&#39;s just one small aspect of me. It doesn&#39;t define me, my political leanings, hobbies or my beliefs, it&#39;s just another biological part of me, like my eye color or the fact that i&#39;m left handed. None of this matters. What should matter is the content of your character, if you&#39;re a toxic person or not.

I hope in 50 years people won&#39;t feel so hesitant to be themselves. I am still coming to terms with myself and my sexual identity because at one point it was drilled into me that some people fake being gay. So in high school when I had a boyfriend for a few years (still with him) but was also watching lesbian porn I was really confused. I didn&#39;t want to be in a relationship with a girl or I couldn&#39;t see myself being in a relationship with a girl yet I was watching lesbian porn. I brushed it aside and just kept telling myself I couldn&#39;t be a lesbian and I couldn&#39;t be bi since I didn&#39;t want to date girls. Once I found out that my definition of bi was wrong (many years later) I started to wonder if maybe I was bi but was still scared to think about it because I didn&#39;t want to be &quot;faking it&quot; without knowing it. Was being sexually attracted to girls enough? What if I hadn&#39;t found a girl I would like to hook up with in real life is it maybe just a fantasy of mine and not what I actually want? Maybe I do have those thoughts but I&#39;ve drilled it into myself that I can&#39;t. It&#39;s something I still am struggling with today and I&#39;m scared to tell people since I can&#39;t fully accept it myself.,0

Humans are by far the frickin weirdest creatures when it comes to sexual preferences. Literally. Aren’t there something like 72 genders according to... uh... people?? The closest animal that we get to this... behavior is the flamingo. That’s. It. They RARELY (but sometimes) have same gender relationships and one time I even heard from a zoo that there was a trio relationship. If you want to bring up the topic of animals that literally change gender; those animals ACTUALLY change gender (into a BOI OR GURL that’s it). Humans... we physically CANNOT change gender. It’s not possible. Also all the people in this video kinda look the same ngl,1
"I’m pretty sure the show will be condemned and criticized tooooo much. And coming back to the video, it is waaaaaaay too second and third wave and the black/white dichotomy makes it really not too safe for lots of people in the world. Sigh. Maybe she should have just stayed in Ray Donovan",0

What’s wrong with being straight? So the lgbtq is everything besides straight. Why not include being straight so at the end of the day people just like whatever they like and as long as they don’t force others to do or want anything the. We can all live peacefully. If it had that meaning I think that would be better. Idk if it’s just me but the lgbtq being everything besides straight seems like the wrong direction. Cause people also have fetishes but they don’t decide to define themselves based on their fetishes. Not saying that the lgbtq is basically just fetishes but people focus way to damn hard on their sexuality. You like what you like and it’s that simple.,1

This is soooo pretentious and narcissistic. They make it sound like they are so woke and experienced in life. Sorry but because of people like this the lgbt community has been losing approval for the first time in years.,1
"I recently rewatched the entirety of the original l word and I was honestly surprised by a lot of the blatantly transphobic, racist and biphobic things that were written. the show didn’t age well at all but I understand that it’s just a reflection of society and the culture at the time. max’s storyline in particular fucked up my perception of trans men and made me hesitant to admit that I was trans for a long time which sounds ridiculous but he was and unfortunately still is one of the only representations of trans men on tv so I’m honestly just glad that they seem to be being more inclusive and conscious this time around. when I first started watching the show I was maybe 10 or 11 years old and I identified as a lesbian, now I’m 22 and I identify as a bi/queer trans man. crazy how things change over time but it just goes to show you how important representation is",0

"We had a discussion about nonbinary gender identity at my workplace yesterday.  There were two RN&#39;s who are millennials (and one had said a handful of things against LGBTQ rights in the past year that I&#39;ve worked with her).  We&#39;ve had LGBTQ patients (including trans and nonbinary), but they hadn&#39;t given much thought into nonbinary gender identity being a legit until Billy Dee Williams just came out.  Suddenly, they didn&#39;t know how to respond or how to approach learning about this, and I (as a likely trans illustrator with a day job at a hospital) started diagraming ways of explaining this subject to two educated young people who grew up with STEM programs.<br><br>They looked at me, asking what &quot;nonbinary&quot; means.  To these computer savvy peers, I gave the example of binary code (explaining that for a long time many societies only considered there to be two gender identities).  Then I integrated 2&#39;s, 3&#39;s, 4&#39;s, and 5&#39;s into an example of what was a line of binary code (0&#39;s and 1&#39;s).  Comprehension was hit or miss, so I then diagrammed a gender spectrum, stating that cisgender, trans, or nonbinary, each person&#39;s gender identity can fit somewhere along the spectrum between male and female and sometimes legitimately fluctuate in such cases as gender fluidity.  They got a better understanding of the subject.  It was sort of like when I explained gender dysphoria to an some IV nurses saying that they are like Pop Tarts or instant oatmeal packets, where just through a twist of fate, who they are is misrepresented by the box that the manufacturer had accidentally shipped them out in.<br><br>It wasn&#39;t until I was in my early 30&#39;s that I started becoming more self-conscious of whether I was miscommunication my gender identity (my having Asperger&#39;s may have affected realization on how important physical expression of self can be in communicating with everyone other than myself).  I started exploring gender expression (for the first time in decades) through Second Life and Pokemon Go avatars.  The morning after the Pulse shooting (Pride weekend in many cities including, my own), I decided that I should be openly proud of whatever I am as I began figuring out what gender (and relatively, what sexuality labels) I identify with I&#39;ve gone from walking with my church in the Pride parade to volunteering at a call center to protect a state law prohibiting discrimination against trans and nonbinary people (in so much partisan irony, the law was signed by a republican governor, and it was a famously blue state that was trying to referendum against the law being upheld).  I&#39;ve started growing my hair out, and have been increasingly working in more feminine aesthetics into my personal style.  While people may think that clothing should not be explicitly &quot;masculine&quot; or &quot;feminine&quot;, it&#39;s those possibilities in gender-related clothing which can be more affirming for people who aren&#39;t cisgender, while striping away the gender association could make people more dysphoric.",0

(On the ace spectrum but no specific label or multiple labels)<br><br>At least I think that’s what it is?",0
I&#39;m not gay or anything I&#39;m just I guess mainstream heterosexual but I I honestly honestly believe that people should be identified if they want to be identified for who and what they are and what they stand for truly we have one life on this planet we need to be good to each other that&#39;s what my dad used to say and my dad broke away from Mormonism big time when he married my mom cuz my mom was a mother Earth follower. I had a really great parents growing up I I only wish that for other people I&#39;m totally blown away by how cruel and how mean and how broken the belief system can be and forced upon a child or their teenager or their young adult is is baffling to me one life it&#39;s all we have unless you know one of those people that believe in reincarnation and hey more power to you I like I like the idea trust. But really we just need to be good to each other That&#39;s all I got to say thank you so much for the video,0

I wish people would get over this fad of &quot;INCLUSION&quot;.. cuz that&#39;s exactly 💯 what it is.. a fad.. 99% of homosexuality is choice and is pushed by mainstream media and &quot;WOKE&quot; corporations who in reality don&#39;t give 2 f$%KS about yalls cause... if u don&#39;t believe me look at scientific studies and see how RARE GENDER DISPHORIA truly is people.. WAKE UP.. I am I liberal for the most part and a combat medic and veteran of this country.. I spoke with an E6 staff Sgt today and he even agreed the direction we are going is extremely dangerous and we need to WAKE UP TO REALITY.... SO WAKE UP and stop believing the lies PLEASE people!!,1
"Maybe I&#39;m queer. But I&#39;m straight. But every time someone ask me if I&#39;m a girl i get second thoughts and i feel uncomfortable when someone label me as a girl. But I&#39;m straight,I&#39;m not bisexual but i like wearing boyish clothing. I dont want to be identified as SOMEONE or SOMETHING. I love considering myself, as a person, who is capable of love and everything",0
"that’s the point they fail there own ideology they want gender fluidity to rid the idea of boxing /categorising  so the give not giving a label by giving it a label and labelling it lol , all things need to be categorised it’s how we identify the works around us",1
why are American people so desperate for labels? I don&#39;t understand it,0

Still i don&#39;t know really ...what is queer?!!!🤯🤯,1

"I think... judging by this video, “queer” means you don’t know what the hell you want to identify yourself as. Literally.",1
"F ing  stupid, it either you are male of female end up, be bi that&#39;s fine or tran that&#39;s up to you.. What tae f is queer, then you have non binary you all re jokes",1
"If you are still confused, it&#39;s understandable. You got an explanation from the confused ones",0
the first person sounds like they’re about to cry so if that’s their normal voice then rip,0
So the SJWs got offeneded by people saying they where super straight and saying it wasnt a sexuality... because blah blah homophoia blah blah transphoia blah blah.  Yet these same peeople have never ever critisted a single queer person.  And apprently queer is not wnating a label for sexuality or/and gender.,1
So if someone doesnt identify with any label including queer are they hyper queer.  4 Billion years of evolution and we somehow ended up at this.,1
Why is S for straight not in there ? Its a sexual preference don&#39;t be ignoring us . SLGBTQ . All you need is the first initial the rest is bullshit .,1
"im so done understanding this shi what does it even mean , my ex best friend is queer and i still dont get it like WHAT DOES IT MEAN ?!",1
The real meaning of queer is strange or unusual. I understand what this video is about but the title is cringe.,0
I came out of this video more confused than these confused people,0
I thought &quot;queer&quot; was an umbrella term for people who dont identify as heterosexual or cisgender? Im so confused,0
Queer is the most confusing term for me. It&#39;s way to generic. Does it include non-binary? Gender fluid? Or what?,0
"So, what? Do you mean that queer means someone who isn&#39;t sure of their sexuality yet?",0
I consider myself queer so that might be the reason why im confused why people in the comments are confused. honestly the description fits perfectly in my eyes,0
I&#39;m as lost as they are,0
Man!! why are they all girls? No dudes,0
So it means a label for people who don’t fit into the other labels I think,0
Still dont know what this means😅,0
Why are they so angry,0
"Thanks, I learned nothing.",0
I think I’m mostly straight. I’ve only dated one guy before but it didn’t work out. But a little part of me likes everyone. I honestly want to go Pansexual.,0

here joon for that moment brought me to tears my really name is wyly so you know what that came with,0
Love the vid but I swear the more I try to understand all these labels the more confusing it gets why can&#39;t we all just be humans regardless who you love or don&#39;t 👍,0
I&#39;m really stuck with what I feel is my gender and what I identify as and after this I think I might know but I&#39;m still stuck but honestly I let people call me whatever because I don&#39;t care and I sometimes feel like I&#39;m not a girl or I&#39;m not a boy and I&#39;m just neither so I let people call me whatever.. but I am not sure if there is a label for what I feel that I am and this kind of opened my eyes a little ✨,0
They look like normal Seattle people,0
I’m here because apparently jojo came out and I’m confused 🤷🏾‍♀️ not to be mean or disrespectful,0
"So what I gather from this video, is that &quot;queer&quot; means &quot;confused as fuck.&quot;",1
Asian nerd had a safety pin stuck in earlobe,0
i actually didn&#39;t understand,0
"they didn&#39;t explain what a queer is and I see alot of people here are confused. Let me explain:<br>You got yourself a job and in the job interview you meet the boss of the company, and the first thing you notice is that you can&#39;t even see if it&#39;s a guy or a girl, so you go with the &quot;he&quot; pronoun as default, since, after all, you didn&#39;t see the tits. You try to use every technique you can to tell the gender - the voice, the hair, the waist, the face (does he has mascara?) but you see no mascara, he seems to have a waist like a lady and the voice is well... like justin bieber.<br>After a whole interview of confusion you decide to take the giant step and ask him &quot;Sorry for asking this, but are you a woman or a man&quot;<br>He respond,<br>&quot;I am queer - I have no gender.&quot;<br>You got even more confused - how can somebody not have a gender? what pronoun do you even use for such a person? &quot;He&quot;? &quot;She&quot;? &quot;XE????&quot;<br><br><br>But that&#39;s the point of being a queer - a queer person doesn&#39;t want you to label &quot;xim&quot; as a man or a woman, cause he identifies with having no gender.<br><br><br>That&#39;s why I think they are so wonderful - They mindfuck every person they meet, and make people around them question their own reality.",1
But why use the word queer to identify with when queer means strange. Why not use a different label 🏷.,0
When you know you&#39;re born a male/female but still don&#39;t know what you are?,1
Not trynna come out mean but how can u not know what you are I mean we all have different body parts and even if you change that your still that same gender a least to me that&#39;s my opinion please don&#39;t get mad that&#39;s what u think,1
Ion get it,0
"None of the comments i have seen are good or at least nice, so here it is, i&#39;m trying ti find myself in the community aswell so this vdeo helped a lot and thanks to every single one in the video you seem so amazing",0
I can&#39;t keep up. I&#39;m SHANsexual,1
"If the word Queer can umbrella the entire LGBT community; than why do we need all the other letters?  <br><br>Not trying to be rude or condescending, would it be easier if queer was the standard terminology? <br><br>Using the word queer in reference to the term odd is very 19th century. <br><br>Our language has improved so why can&#39;t we just make this adjustment. <br><br>I&#39;m just a 50-year-old hetero male trying to make sense of the modern world and not offend anybody.",0
im an attack helicopter,1
This lgbt thing is such a mess. I really ducked up campaigning for everything at once. Shoulda kept tings seperate. I really think trans is as legitimate as intersex?,1
"identified as a lesbian, now found a boy that’s really nice and cute and now I’m hella confused 🤠✌️",0
Your a man or a woman,0
So it’s a girl that wants to looks like boy-girl  but still likes boys and girls .. got it but still think they confused or don’t want to be label because they are not ready 🤷‍♀️,1
Is LGBTQ+ a gay premium,0
"I also think that, there is need no to appear unique or as a fashion icon just because you belong to certain &quot;community&quot;",0
I&#39;m still confused. So genderqueer is basically us being our self? Or does it have other meaning to it? Oh my lord Ainz Ooal Gown please help me.,0
so they&#39;re in the middle? they somehow have a label of being non labeled? i guess i cant get this <b>straight</b>,0
I’m not here to hear about your whole life story what the fuck is a queer 😂,1
i’m so confused,0
They use such big words when i just want a simple definition,0
You are a queer Harry.!!!<br>I am a what??<br>Yes that&#39;s right 👍,0
"Odd, Unusual, Really different. These mixed up genders want to throw it in your face. Yes we get it, your a butt puncher, stop forcing your &quot;agenda&quot; on us and knock it off with the circle jerks in your parades, kids are around.",1
"So why say queer and not bisexual? I still don’t understand and this video just made it more confusing, does it mean your hair is buzzed on one side? I have no clue",0
Dis shi gae af lol XD,1
why they all look weird?,0
I’m a trans attack helicopter,1
"They are just confused idiots, they basically think <b>gender</b> is a socially constituted thing..you see all of them aren’t wearing clothings or acting like it matches with their gender as THEY are thinking, but here’s the deal..yes society has classified things according to the majority of the gender are associated with, as being feminine or masculine, but if you don’t fall into that majority that matches with your gender, it doesn’t make you genderless you idiot special snowflake, there’s nothing, I repeat NOTHING is called gender identity, that is complete bullshit, I really don’t know how the dumbest people on earth are becoming scientist and now explaining things that aren’t even there, oh god",1
If you want to be something different then what you&#39;re born as then fine. But don&#39;t expect and force people to view you in the same light. You&#39;ll be seen as you are not as you want to be.,1
you dont have to know who or what you are and that&#39;s ok??? ho no!!!! what a world we live,1
I think that there shouldn&#39;t be a label for kind of sexuality.... Because why should anybody care whom you are in love with? I think the idea of this came from reproduction... Because a female and a male can reproduce and that&#39;s what people identified as nature so the idea of a male and a male or a female and a female relationship seemed to them as something against the nature.... If you know what I mean. But these two things are totally different because love is more than just reproducing that&#39;s why I think that there shouldn&#39;t be a label like being gay or straight or whatever... That should not be significant. <br>You love who you love.,0
So basically there confused and dont want a label so choose to be under an umbrella,0
this doesn’t explain it at all,0
Is it not bisexual,0
isn’t it funny when girls thinks their boys but don’t have masculine chromosomes,1
"So it&#39;s when you don&#39;t really know what you are, but you just know that you&#39;re not straight",0
I&#39;m already 22 Y.O. but omg... got this Identity. So am I not the only felt like this. Thanks everyone.,0

Bruh?,0
Quick tip: you can be female / male without following gender stereotypes!,0
weren&#39;t there like 10 other &quot;genders&quot; that are the exact same thing?,1
Does queer mean you dont know what sexuality you are..? I dont understands,1
Lol when she says only i know who i am.... well clearely you dont.,1
"They could’ve just said it’s an umbrella term for anyone who identified as something outside of heterosexual or heteronormative. Instead they just had people talk about themselves, which is great, but it didn’t really explain the answer to the question. This is why people get confused.",0
Oh i know she/him sexual is girl and transgender and hard to chose no lipstick or lipstick and the gender was Transgender,1
No sense,0
Your is like a asshole you should make video according to the title.,0
"So I googled “Queer” and it says that it means strange, odd, or freakish. So don’t be a Queer or trans.",1
So &#39;&#39;queer&#39;&#39; means the term for those who don&#39;t understand their gender...?? I mean they possess both genders in mind and can&#39;t completely explain which is the domineering one...!!<br>Am i right God...??,1
thank you for this video I know I am late but this has really helped me.  thank you,0
"wait,  i am very confused what is my sexuality but i can tell im pretty gay and not straight but at somepoint there will be possibilities in the future that i might be with a man so it&#39;s really confusing but rn i hate boys/men. But for some reason i don&#39;t want to label myself or identify myself to something. But i know to myself im gay. so im just a girl who&#39;s gay and confused",0
"(A venting mess of an essay)<br><br>I hate when people refer to me by my gender, as girl, chick, lady, woman, female, whatever, but any male equivalents don&#39;t suit me and I certainly don&#39;t thing going by &quot;they&quot; or the x pronouns are fitting. So I settle with my assigned at birth gender, and I don&#39;t know why, but it makes me kind of uncomfortable. Maybe it&#39;s due to bad experiences with the expectation to fit those labels, maybe it&#39;s because some people refer to me this way to be somewhat demeaning, or maybe I have a lot of exploring to do. On top of all that mess of nonsense, I am attracted to all genders.<br><br>Ultimately I want to identify as queer, until I find an identity that I see myself in, if ever. It&#39;s like the Hermes cabin in Camp Halfblood! But because of the state of mind that some people have against the word (as it used to be a slur), or against the idea of identifying as queer (it&#39;s too different and too outlandish) I ultimately settle as a cisgendered bisexual, even if I don&#39;t think it fits me.<br><br>I feel like I&#39;m lying to myself. It&#39;s not about the label, it&#39;s about trying to find myself, and what will make me comfortable. Right now, someone harmlessly calling me &quot;girlie&quot;, &quot;chica&quot; or &quot;female&quot; makes me tense up and I WISH I knew why.<br><br>Also, this video that is supposed to raise awareness and promote open-mindedness towards the concept of queer is an unfortunate failure. It was too surface level and didn&#39;t so much go into the definition of queer, which I think is why so many people were estranged more than anything. A more suitable title would be &quot;Why I identify as queer&quot; or &quot;How I found the Queer identity.&quot; As is, the title leads people to click expecting to get a definition. It would fit as a great intro to something that might go more in depth or be more grounded.",0
"Something or someone that is strange or odd. If I was attracted to the same sex as myself I would be offended to be labeled queer. I am not strange or odd, just a different sexual preference. Thats it no big deal dont call me odd or strange for it.",0
the homophobia in these comments...Chile,0
They still didn’t explain what it was🤣,0
"So, they are basically BI",0

Oh my God 🤭,0
"these comments are so rude and disrespectful. it’s okay not to understand something but some of these comments are just straight up homophobic. let people do what they want, it doesn’t hurt you.",0
It&#39;s basically a identity for people who cannot find a identity.,0
"So what you are saying is it means absolutely nothing. Makes sense, thanks....",0
So its sexuality not a gender,0
Too many hate comments. Let the people do them. Mind your own business Karen!,0
"I&#39;m still confused, and no I can&#39;t tell by the video just tell me-",0
I still do not understand what Queer means 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️,0

"A lot of negative replies here so I want to add something! I’m queer and I identify as this because it’s an umbrella term meaning “not straight or not cisgender”. I’ve always felt fluid with my sexual orientation and gender identity so being queer allows me to like who I like and feel what I feel without worrying about whether or not I’m fitting into a specific box. So to anyone uncomfortable or upset about the usage of the term queer, it literally has nothing to do with you. Mind your own. 💖💗💕🌺🍒<br><br>Edit: instead of being pressed about what label somebody uses to explain their sexuality / gender how about focusing on actual issues that affect this community??? Do y’all get upset abt queer eye?? lol",0
Humans are by far the frickin weirdest creatures when it comes to sexual preferences. Literally. Aren’t there something like 72 genders according to... uh... people?? The closest animal that we get to this... behavior is the flamingo. That’s. It. They RARELY (but sometimes) have same gender relationships and one time I even heard from a zoo that there was a trio relationship. If you want to bring up the topic of animals that literally change gender; those animals ACTUALLY change gender (into a BOI OR GURL that’s it). Humans... we physically CANNOT change gender. It’s not possible. Also all the people in this video kinda look the same ngl,1

So queer is a straight person who tries to be Bisexual?,1
What’s wrong with being straight? So the lgbtq is everything besides straight. Why not include being straight so at the end of the day people just like whatever they like and as long as they don’t force others to do or want anything the. We can all live peacefully. If it had that meaning I think that would be better. Idk if it’s just me but the lgbtq being everything besides straight seems like the wrong direction. Cause people also have fetishes but they don’t decide to define themselves based on their fetishes. Not saying that the lgbtq is basically just fetishes but people focus way to damn hard on their sexuality. You like what you like and it’s that simple.,1

"Thank you. I&#39;m older, and when I was in middle and high school, calling someone &quot;queer&quot; was a horrible insult. I&#39;ve always had a hard time saying it. Kind of like the &quot;n&quot; word. Thanks for helping me understand it&#39;s meaning and that it&#39;s not necessarily a bad word.",0
So basically it means people who don&#39;t know what they like or what gender or sex they are..(just an opinion),1
"FYI. There’s something called personal fault. Its where you believe that you are something but because of your lack of self consciousness, you end up not being able to see what you truly are and that’s where friends and family come in. They tell you what you’re doing and what’s happening when you can’t see clearly at the time. Not to say that friends and family know everything because of course they aren’t you so they can never know feel the degree of emotion that you feel but they can understand it with time and all of you can work together on becoming better and making each other better by identifying each other’s flaws and fixing them but not bullying each other with those flaws",0
At the end of the day. When you label stuff you are just conforming to society. If you care that much about labels then you probably care that much about the opinions of people or you did when you did care. My point is that at the end of the day it comes down to what you think about yourself and how much you let what people tell you affect you.,0

"This &quot;umbrella term&quot; is for people who think/feel/believe that being labelled as gay or bi isn&#39;t good enough for them, perpetuating elitism within the LGBT community.",1

You don&#39;t explain anything. You hyst share your personal issues and involve  EVERYBODY in them. <br>But they&#39;re only yours :),0
"They like who they like, love who they love, and are whatever or whoever they are. They don&#39;t want the stress of having a label claiming they&#39;re this, or that they&#39;re that, they are just human. (Also just a quick question: If you go by non binary pronouns or opposite gender pronouns, can you just say that&#39;s queer as well or do you have to say, &quot;I&#39;m non binary and queer.&quot; ?)",0
I came here to see if I was queer and I don’t even know if I’m queer either 😂,0
I CRIED WTF THIS IS SO RELATABLE,0
"since people still seem to be confused: identifying as queer means loving whoever you want, despite you or the other person’s gender identity; it’s basically an umbrella term which many other sexualities/identities can fall under",0
"Just tell us ,WHAT THE HELL IS &quot;QUEER&quot;",1
So Queer is when you don’t know what you are... I’m still confused 🤷🏽‍♀️???,1

Or I&#39;m everything,0
Omg i not bi I&#39;m queer or both😅,0
"My thoughts: I think there is a difference between sexuality and emotional attraction and physical attraction and spiritual attraction. So, to me, if Queer means solely sexual attraction, I&#39;m heterosexual.",0
"I just came here to find out what is means cause I get called it all the time and now I am depressed cause I know what it means now and I don’t want to associate with that, no offense to any but a man can have his own opinion and you can’t get mad at that",0

It’s the new thing to do it’s cool it’s a trend it will did out of use like Facebook did,0
"that’s the point they fail there own ideology they want gender fluidity to rid the idea of boxing /categorising  so the give not giving a label by giving it a label and labelling it lol , all things need to be categorised it’s how we identify the works around us",1
I think according to this video <br>LGBT= Q,0

"Is it me or do these types of individuals all look the same? They always have weird haircuts which are often dyed to these luminous/florescent colors, loads of piercings in weird places, tattoos and colorful clothing.",0
Lol still doesn’t make any sense😂,0
"A false statement ,The more That we realise that  gender and sexuality are all made up and are just lie ok then why do you want to be so conservative and add to the conventional concept of categorising and boxing people into yet another form, you can love who ever you want but genders tend to help you know who it is your attracted to",0

"Can somebody help me, I usually date boys but actually my first dating partner was a girl(my mom&#39;s boss daughter), I had a crush on a trans guy, I like the female curves on guys and love the mansculity of a woman, usually a girl who is like a guy... I like middle hair for both... I would date anyone who fits into that category... What the heck am I? I only date one person at a time... I identify myself as a girl, I also have a vaj... That&#39;s for who I am, I sometimes dress boss and others cute and girly.... Mostly 80s style but I want to know what am I?",0
So is queer bi? Pan? I’m still so confused,0
"queer to me means non-normative, non-conformative ... we are not comfortable with the identity of the lgbt part but we are definitely not heterosexual..some can still be said confused but mostly we are intelligent..we discover ourselves and research more..",0
i was still looking for the meaning but naah,0
"They are bunch of confused people who don&#39;t know what there sexuality is, what&#39;s going on to this world",0
i love this and I&#39;m glad there&#39;s a video talking about it! :),0
"So what I gather from this video, is that &quot;queer&quot; means &quot;confused as fuck.&quot;",1
Am i the only person who didnt get the answer?,0
Gender is not a lie but sexuality might be.,0
"they didn&#39;t explain what a queer is and I see alot of people here are confused. Let me explain:<br>You got yourself a job and in the job interview you meet the boss of the company, and the first thing you notice is that you can&#39;t even see if it&#39;s a guy or a girl, so you go with the &quot;he&quot; pronoun as default, since, after all, you didn&#39;t see the tits. You try to use every technique you can to tell the gender - the voice, the hair, the waist, the face (does he has mascara?) but you see no mascara, he seems to have a waist like a lady and the voice is well... like justin bieber.<br>After a whole interview of confusion you decide to take the giant step and ask him &quot;Sorry for asking this, but are you a woman or a man&quot;<br>He respond,<br>&quot;I am queer - I have no gender.&quot;<br>You got even more confused - how can somebody not have a gender? what pronoun do you even use for such a person? &quot;He&quot;? &quot;She&quot;? &quot;XE????&quot;<br><br><br>But that&#39;s the point of being a queer - a queer person doesn&#39;t want you to label &quot;xim&quot; as a man or a woman, cause he identifies with having no gender.<br><br><br>That&#39;s why I think they are so wonderful - They mindfuck every person they meet, and make people around them question their own reality.",1
I love what Join said. I think we all have something about us we are uncomfortable with when young that we learn to love as we get older. And I love that he not just comfortable with his name but himself.,0
huh might as well call yourself unlabelled,0
"Doesn&#39;t fully explain it. But again, I&#39;m not into the whole label BS. It just seems there&#39;s a label for everything now and it&#39;s becoming ridiculous. My opinion.",0
Thank you for making this video I finally know where I belong!,0
What if your cisgender but use many terms for your sexuality,0
Sorry fam but I still think is offensive word,0
"Jordan Peterson is and art snob too, he talks about this before how &quot;art has a million interpretations&quot; or &quot;the author is inside an spirit or force or blah blah that guides them&quot; i dislike it when he gets fruity and talks about art and i dont really know what to think either way. I do believe that, as Homer describes, the Muses guide the creation of art like how you wanted to write &quot;the prince&quot; but the muses wrote a story for you. and saying art has many different interpretations is BAD, imagine if a girl i don&#39;t know smiles at me am i allowed to interpret that like &quot;she wants to have s*x&quot; no i don&#39;t know that person there is context and stuff that needs to be considered. you can say &quot;hey your answer to &#39;when we go down to the nuances there is no wrong or right answer!&#39; appears to be &#39;murder is still wrong&#39; and that is disingenuous&quot; well you can say that you might be right but i believe in these muses that experience emotions powerful enough to pull my emotions (which is why i don&#39;t like art) but i don&#39;t think anything in existence escapes the judgment between good and bad, up and down, left and right, win and lose.",1
did not answer the question...,0
im an attack helicopter,1
This lgbt thing is such a mess. I really ducked up campaigning for everything at once. Shoulda kept tings seperate. I really think trans is as legitimate as intersex?,1

It is what it is,0
nobody can&#39;t define queer,0
i knew you used to be a man thats cool that you are a transexual now,1

Why did they get so much screen time if they didn’t answer the question? Who edited this?,0
"If no one can tell me what queer is I&#39;m going to consult  Merriam Webster, and roll with it.  You can&#39;t be nothing because that&#39;s you&#39;re going to be treated.",0

"I hate when someone talks about philosophy and knowledge and at the same time he does the most bizarre and illogical thing like transsexuality ! I mean, this man changed his gender and murderd biology, how dare he talk about science and knowledge ? This is contradictory",1
"They are just confused idiots, they basically think <b>gender</b> is a socially constituted thing..you see all of them aren’t wearing clothings or acting like it matches with their gender as THEY are thinking, but here’s the deal..yes society has classified things according to the majority of the gender are associated with, as being feminine or masculine, but if you don’t fall into that majority that matches with your gender, it doesn’t make you genderless you idiot special snowflake, there’s nothing, I repeat NOTHING is called gender identity, that is complete bullshit, I really don’t know how the dumbest people on earth are becoming scientist and now explaining things that aren’t even there, oh god",1
This is Clickbait lol,0
huh?😂,0

This explains nothing!,0
so you say you identify as queer but you also don’t like labels 🤦‍♀️,0
No one understood so here we go<br><br><br>I believe it’s when u don’t really care at all about the gender or sexuality of a person u just love them because u do<br><br>Sorta like pansexuality <br>But it’s different because u don’t have to know about how u feel i have no idea xD,0
I&#39;m asexual (meaning I&#39;m not attracted to men or women),0
"There are a lot of confused people so this is what the video was getting at, (although no it didn&#39;t explicitly say it): Queer is an umbrella term for people who don&#39;t feel comfortable conforming to gender norms and or who aren&#39;t heterosexual. I think that&#39;s what it means.",0
Only two Genders. Male and Female.,1
Why not just call yourself bi,0
Wtf is that means I am more confused now,0
You guys are promoting the moral decline of society. Degenerates.,0
weren&#39;t there like 10 other &quot;genders&quot; that are the exact same thing?,1

I can understand this concept .. In Tamil film I.. There&#39;s a character called Love.. He&#39;s a man.. But having a attitude like woman and loves makeup and style... India has to learn more..,0
isnt queer and bisexual the same? Im more confused now,0
"So I googled “Queer” and it says that it means strange, odd, or freakish. So don’t be a Queer or trans.",1
So &#39;&#39;queer&#39;&#39; means the term for those who don&#39;t understand their gender...?? I mean they possess both genders in mind and can&#39;t completely explain which is the domineering one...!!<br>Am i right God...??,1
ok so thought the comments section would be having a ton of haters but it doesnt it has something better confused haters....,0
"If you understand being confused about your identity you understand queer.<br>Would you, queer identifying, agree?",0
queer is a old homophobic insult stop calling homosexuals queer its insulting,0

"So for those who want equality, and be treated &quot; JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE &quot; is looking for a label?",0

Gender and sexuality are made up and a lie??? What?!,0
Damn this is so confusing and dumb honestly,0
That is not how the word  queer was used in the book chronicles of Narnia.  Or  how it was taught when I was in school.              QUEER =ODD,0
good luck,0
YOU IDIOTS STILL DID NOT EXPLAIN OR GET TO THE POINT!,0
the comments from idiot bigots make me sad for this generation.,0
Soooooo queer means gender-neutral?,0
"I like girls but I sometimes I like boys but not in a sexual/bi way and identify as queer because it sounds better and doesn&#39;t have a full definition. And it feels less toxicated against others. I&#39;m gay but  prefer to label myself as queer. Kinda difficult to explain, mainly because it&#39;s a personal reason.",0
Im so jealous of their skin 🥺😢🙄🙏,0
Comment section:<br>30% Queer means when person is questioning and don&#39;t know who to like girl or boys. Or maybe gender fluid! Term is used to call umbrella.<br>70%..... <b>But what the fuck is queer?</b>,1
So queer is a straight person who tries to be Bisexual?,1
You are what you are born as. That’s that!,0
"After a couple years of discovering my sexuality, I finally landed on the word queer/ pan to describe my sexuality. I didn’t like the blocks that the word gay or bi came with so I wanted more of a umbrella term. Sometimes people ask me how gay I am, and unfortunately saying queer doesn’t suffice so I say 90% gay 10% straight just to make it easier for other people... lol.",0

"I&#39;ma go ahead and stop you right there...  &quot;Gender and sexuality are pretty much made up and a lie....&quot;  Human chromosomes, the 23rd pair specifically, are either XX (female) or XY (male). This is Human DNA/Genetics. It isn&#39;t made up and/or a lie. That aside... you can call yourself whatever you want. Live your life how it makes you happy at the end of the day. But don&#39;t try and tell the world that gender is a lie... that is just a misinformation campaign spreading ignorance. You want to not call yourself a man or a woman, that is your call, because at the end of the day, you&#39;re still just a person like the rest of us.",1
"Sorry, gender is related to biological sex, always.",1
"Since most people don&#39;t know, and either do I, Here is the answer. ( I googled, read comments, etc.)<br><br>So queer is when your not sure if you like Girls, boys, or both. Queer is like a umbrella term. It&#39;s like you like girls, you like boys, and you might like both and you figuring that out. Bi is when you know that you like girls and boys. Personally, I feel that they are the same, But I don&#39;t know all the information. Thanks for reading! Yeah, I know it was long.<br><br><br>Please like this if it helped your understanding",0

If you think you can change your gender you are mentally ill,1
So wait isn&#39;t that just bisexual?,0
Head hurts,0
"Yes scientifically there are two genders but if an individual feels like they&#39;re one or the other or neither why does it bother a lot of you that a person chooses to identify a certain way ? It has nothing to do with you. Would it kill you to just go with it and be accepting?

I thought queer meant somebody who sits down when they pee. In 7th grade during band practice my friend randomly brought up something about aiming in the bathroom and I started laughing because I thought he was kidding because I was like dude are you like 5? So they started calling me a queer. Yea. That&#39;s it.,0
Ok so for people who are still confused “queer” is basically not part of the binary system. It’s an umbrella term for people who aren’t straight and or cisgender. It’s for people who don’t feel attached to any specific label regarding their sexuality and or gender. It’s kinda similar to pansexual and bisexual. Bisexual is still apart of a binary system(one or the other) where pan is all. Queer does not necessarily mean gay. If someone identifies as queer just respect that and except it. And queer is not a slur any more than the word gay is so stop saying someone’s identity is a slur because that’s ignorant af,0

If people get something out of them, I&#39;m glad these paintings exist. Not all art has to be for me.

Sometimes, it is about perspective, and what you see up there will be completely different from what your friend sees, even if they&#39;re right next to you, and both of your points of veiw are very different from what you would see from up above.Sometimes, it&#39;s about objectivity, because what the clouds look like day to day can matter. They tell you things about the world around you and that can influence your day and what  your plans for it can be.Sometimes, it isn&#39;t about anything at all. Sometimes a cloud is just a cloud.",0
"art: looking at ourselves, reflected, is all i know :p and by ourselves so our imagination(s) of others. what we distill as true to their uttered intentions and our witnessed actions- among with the thoughts we discard of them, at the time of appraising and discarding.

I love Abigail. She demonstrates these topics so well.,0
NO by no means is art meaningless and that&#39;s an argument that sets a dangerous precedent.But you know who is meaningless? Jordan Peterson.,0
"Jordan Peterson is and art snob too, he talks about this before how &quot;art has a million interpretations&quot; or &quot;the author is inside an spirit or force or blah blah that guides them&quot; i dislike it when he gets fruity and talks about art and i dont really know what to think either way. I do believe that, as Homer describes, the Muses guide the creation of art like how you wanted to write &quot;the prince&quot; but the muses wrote a story for you. and saying art has many different interpretations is BAD, imagine if a girl i don&#39;t know smiles at me am i allowed to interpret that like &quot;she wants to have s*x&quot; no i don&#39;t know that person there is context and stuff that needs to be considered. you can say &quot;hey your answer to &#39;when we go down to the nuances there is no wrong or right answer!&#39; appears to be &#39;murder is still wrong&#39; and that is disingenuous&quot; well you can say that you might be right but i believe in these muses that experience emotions powerful enough to pull my emotions (which is why i don&#39;t like art) but i don&#39;t think anything in existence escapes the judgment between good and bad, up and down, left and right, win and lose.",1
"I&#39;m so confused. In thinking on art, and what qualifies as art, and how we define art as meaningful or valuable, it had me thinking on other things that are abstract but we imbue with &quot;value&quot;, like fancy but impractical jewelry, or even ideals like &quot;justice.&quot; From things like that to constructs like NFTs, the things only have value because we say they have value, and once people say &quot;no, those links to JPEGs of easily mass-produced monkeys don&#39;t have value&quot;, then they don&#39;t anymore and the market starts crashing. But that applies to ALL of those things. So I&#39;m left with the conclusion that the reason that ART has VALUE is the fact that it exposes the abstract artificiality of the concept of VALUE itself, and how even with value itself being a human social construct of sorts that fact does not deprive it OF that value. Simply because we say so.",0
"12:40 It&#39;s interesting that I&#39;d agree or disagree depending on the type of art. In story-based art like plays, movies, tv shows or video games, I want there to be at least some meaning in there to give the art structure and comprehension. For all the fighting on &quot;ARE VIDEO GAMES ART?!&quot; Video games that are just art, are, ironically, lesser for it.",0

"This video was a whole bunch of nothing tbh. Art is human expression in any form, it does not have to be limited to just painting, film making or writing, it can be anything. It&#39;s a way for you to express your true self to other other people, a way to communicate ideas and feelings and genuine emotions. Sometimes you see the world differently compared to everyone else, you want to make a unique observation that provoked a thought in your head but it&#39;s hard to make others see your perspective to its fullest, so you use art as an outlet for that. It definitely has a meaning and sometimes an intended objective. The artist may not be aware of it themselves but the meaning does exist.",0

This whole video felt like a huge add. Is that really your final thoughts of your exploration at the end? Maybe you should give up on philosophy if you can share so little meaning in your videos.,0

"already bringing in peterson, tim pool, etc.. already has skewed your interpretation.. and your assumptions is not interpretation.speculation and hearsay are also now concrete in the court of law.. you need evidence to back it up.. there is NO interpretation in the eyes of the law.. interpreation does not make things concret and conform to simpler understanding.. it makes it more complicated..  some of your analogies are so political taht i think you should rethink  some of your points.especailly with the bridge analogy.. much art especailly old art was tryign to recreate reality to a T.. there is so much mathematics involved..compositions , etc.. all has planning.. many artist make deliberate thoughtout strokes.. it was only impressionist that started to really go against the grain. that is the evolution of art.art has become meaningless because there is no revolt to a movement anymore.. we have reached a ppoint where it is pure monitary.. everyone can create antyhing.. not many are making art to push against the grain.. we have moved into commercial art..this is why you barely see any real massive moment anymore.. the last movement was street art.. which has been commercialized.",0

So prepare to be unhappy and constantly filling that void.",0
Obviously art has meaning. Every artist creates art to serve some kind of purpose it’s meaning comes from its purpose. Even if an artist try’s to create a piece of art without purpose paradoxically the lack of purpose becomes its purpose.,0

"Yes! By very design art is meaningless. Because meaning doesn&#39;t come from it but from us. To me this is one of the stupidest questions in terms of philosophy.Does that mean creating art is stupid? No! You idiot. Again, meaning is something you give. You can choose to not give it any meaning but then art is useless and that makes life boring. Is that what you want? That&#39;s why I love art! I can fully enjoy almost any piece. Whereas many people limit themselves to liking maybe up to 10 genres, at the very most 30 out of 40. I like 39 out of 40, more like 99 out of 100. I am then, as they say, easily amused. Because life is meant to be enjoyed. Celebrated even. So I celebrate it every day as I think everyone should.

"There was some fallacious logic relying on differing meanings of the word &quot;about&quot; at the start. The example with the Titanic uses &quot;what is it about?&quot; to mean &quot;what is the subject?&quot;, whereas Abi relies on the fact that &quot;what is it about?&quot; can also mean &quot;what is the meaning?&quot; to make her point about correct meanings. Just because one can be wrong about the subject of a piece of art does not necessarily mean one can be wrong about its meaning. It doesn&#39;t affect the rest of the piece, because the same point was made with the example of &quot;Pale Fire&quot;, which is more intuitive as well, but it did irritate me because it seems like a cheap trick to get the audience on her side early on even though she later proved the same point without fallacious logic.",0

Something which comes instinctively natural from yourself rather than conditional (by society) which is where we often get lost.  Let&#39;s say you learn to ride a bike, well it&#39;s quite easy it&#39;s logical, methodical, mechanical and you get it but if you wanna be unique, exceptional or the best in that discipline it requires your artistic side of the whole picture. So is art meaningless? Depends on different ways the environment conditioning you and it&#39;s all in how you think. We all have an artistic side, inner sincerity &amp; devotion of that very situation will show it.",0

"I get it this is Philosophy Digest, But at least disclaim this path of reasoning... Things go fast and loose i&#39;m not asking meta-commentary, nor accuracy or any other style concerns: its a very small idea that philosophy tube never makes: abstract and categorize, lol your videos are already pretty much Aristotelian in their Spirit, encyclopedic, exhaustive and discreet, it&#39;s ok not a criticism, literally every single western mind thinks with Aristotle&#39;s thinking  (Organon). It&#39;d also do more service to philosophy by presenting ideas, concepts, theories, by their names. It&#39;s too partial to avoid saying that, and to talk about public understanding might mean repeating again that idea with each engagement. It makes it look like philosophy is some Critical Something Something Studies 15 year old discipline",0
"What Abby said about being able to tell you&#39;re wrong about art but not necessarily being able to tell if you&#39;re right... this is exactly the same in science, where you can prove something wrong pretty easily, but you can never get to 100% certainty that your model/theory (however accurate its predictions) really reflects the underlying reality.",0

"When I was in secondary school, my best friend and I used to play a game called &quot;artwork&quot; to pass the time. We&#39;d point to an object in the room like a gas tap or a fire alarm and have to make up some sort of politically-correct citation to accompany it. It always left us in stitches because of how close we could make it sound to a genuine piece of art, just by putting some bullshit intention over the top of it. At the end of the day, we still really enjoyed it, and actually started to really appreciate the &quot;art&quot; we created, because the intention was so blatantly bullshitty, it became hilarious. I think that&#39;s why I think modern art like &quot;the comedian&quot; and &quot;take the money and run&quot; deserve to be appreciated, because sometimes the (seemingly wrong)  interpretation of a piece is what makes it enjoyable; like Pale Fire.",0

"11:01 ... and if the work&#39;s creator&#39;s intent is explicitly philosophical? To &quot;get it&quot; you&#39;d need to engage with that philosophy.

My character is convinced that they can&#39;t experience humanity in the way a person does, without being embodied. I also look to the work of Australian philosopher Frank Jackson and his famous essay, &quot;Mary&#39;s Room&quot;",0
"Duchamp&#39;s urinal and anything that came from the Dada Period was a direct counter to the effects of WW1. You will find many fine art during the 1900s and even to this day is an interpration of society at that point as it is happening. It is no longer about capturing an idealistic expectation of what life could be (story book ending, Prince Charming, the Golden Age of Man, little kids playing with a dog on the playground, etc...) Cynical perhaps? Some call it trying to stay grounded in a changing world that has gone insane with no intention of going back.",0

"I do digital art a lot, so much I injured my hand from doing it too much, and yet, I have to do it with a greater purpose. I draw characters for commission, and for my d&amp;d games. I&#39;ve never drawn art not related to one of those two things, and I&#39;ve even tried to draw for drawing sake, and nothing ever comes out of my pen. And when it does, it&#39;s barely sketches. I&#39;ve also never understood, art for arts sake. Paintings like, the scream, all of Picassos works, I look at it all and feel, nothing at all. Of course, that&#39;s just physical art. Things like, stories, plays TV, movies, or my aforementioned d&amp;d games, which is my storytelling medium, those I understand, I understand the want to tell a story, to make someone feel something, to use different concepts in the writing to portray emotions that can&#39;t be conveyed through just explaining them, like that book mentioned about conveying the confusing nature of being trans. I myself have done this in my games, like conveying memory loss by simply, logicing out what the players character would have done, and then simply skip it. The player then gets to fully experience the concept of having lost their memory. I find it very interesting that storytelling makes perfect sense as a form of art, and yet things like immaculate paintings or carved statues, I can recognize the technique and skill needed to create that, but it doesn&#39;t make me feel anything. It gives me the exact same emotional feeling as looking at a freshly painted wall.",0

"2:10  It&#39;s possible that the paintings &quot;mean&quot; something. But It&#39;s also possible that the paintings &quot;do&quot; something.  Think of it this way: One can either try to fit the painting into one&#39;s pre-existing categories  and meanings, in which case its meaning is something you already know, and can already recognize — but just haven&#39;t sorted out yet. Or, you can allow the painting to change you. To change how you see things. If you let it. Changing, being changed, means arriving on the other shore. Gaining a new perspective. Seeing what wasn&#39;t seen before. From this new place, the usefulness of &quot;meaning&quot; diminishes, and one is left not with what something means, but what something is.",0
"There&#39;s a third way to look at the question of the clothing metaphor in MacBeth:  if it was a coincidence, would that matter?  Would that make the metaphor any less present in the final work?

"The part about planning art really GOT to me, I studied design and while im mostly an artist I have a hard time not trying to &quot;design&quot; the pieces I draw and when I realize im doing that I stop and cant really find them &quot;real&quot; anymore, Im afraid and I hate it so much.

"Seeing that room of Rothkos and just letting myself sink into them was one of my most profound museum experiences. I think all these ways of exploring meaning can be valid at different points, but I love the last part about maximizing it&#39;s value through a collective process of meaning-making. Like, let&#39;s play! Let&#39;s stack the deck in favor of this work! It&#39;s such a generous and collaborative way of &quot;consuming&quot; something that actually leaves more behind for everyone.It also does feel like there&#39;s some unknowable &quot;center&quot; to works of art. It may never be possible to know that we&#39;re right, but I almost believe in a collective unconscious lens of &quot;correct&quot; interpretation that we can intuitively sense and get closer to.",0
"45 seconds in aaaaaand you&#39;ve lost me. I&#39;m really quite tired of how little respect is afforded to subjectivist/relativistic points of view by &quot;analytic&quot; philosophers. There is no singular &quot;meaning&quot; to art; it is a message, which necessarily entails both the intention of the artist AND the experience of the audience, and its meaning is to be found in how the audience interprets that message. While the intention of the artist might be considered a matter of fact, art is not experienced as pure intention of the artist—this intention is only experienced second-hand as interpreted through the artist&#39;s chosen medium. Art is, therefore, a necessarily subjective phenomenon, since the audience&#39;s experience of art (which is constituent of its meaning) is necessarily subjective and indirect vis-à-vis the artist&#39;s intention.So, yes, I truly believe that the meaning of art is subjective. You get CLOSE to this in your discussion of Shakespeare and MacBeth, but you fall short of recognizing audience interpretation as the MEANING of art, simply relegating interpretation to a question of VALUE... and then you abandon any further inquiry for a vague mish-mash approach of &#39;combining the other ideas&#39;, and then you discuss the play you&#39;ve written, without coming to any clear conclusion.I suppose I must not really the intended audience for your videos, if those are the sorts of bets you&#39;re making.",0

"The last book I wrote, I sent to my friend to test read and asked him point blank &quot;tell me what this means, because I don&#39;t know yet&quot; and I waited on his answer to help with the editing process, because I figured between the two of us, we could find something coherent. I then guided future drafts towards something of a more explicit meaning. But the intent was never there on the getgo; I just wanted to write a ghost story about cats. At the end of the day, what we get out of art is basically exactly what we put into it. Some people can read LOTR and simply enjoy a pair of Hobbits foiling evil; others can find the passion to write an entire dissertation. I don&#39;t think either are wrong.",0
"Haven&#39;t finished watching yet so I might edit in a bit:The Author/Auteur usually only comes into play after a critical point, when the Artist is famous, distinguished, his intentions matter greatly. He&#39;s a genius and so he should know his stuff! Lesser artists or non artists are afforded much less sovereignty over their work. If you offend your boss with an Email you can&#39;t just arbitrate yourself out of harms way that easily. Intention of course matters, you might after all manage to convince your boss, but clearly it&#39;s not all. Maybe you should&#39;ve known better than calling your boss &quot;Bro&quot;? I think when it comes to Interpretation what is often missed is that it&#39;s a critical function. People want to stand in front of Art like it&#39;s sacred, if it doesn&#39;t have &quot;great meaning&quot; then it&#39;s not really art, is it? But what&#39;s actually important is that you do the interpretation, it&#39;s play. So maybe it&#39;s sacrilegious to say, but Art doesn&#39;t have meaning, it&#39;s ultimately not that important. What&#39;s important is that people get to play.",0
"When I draw stuff I don&#39;t really try to interpret it. I just let other people think about what it is. I&#39;m not an artist, but still. I just kinda draw, with little to no real idea and just turn it into what my brain sees. I mean obviously my pfp is just a happy face, but I mostly draw a mix of icons, abstract, and realism (to the best of my ability lol).",0
is art meaningless? your life is meaningless but not in the edgy type of way it just is exactly like that. meaningless more as in inutile and useless kind of vibe. ik like just shut up and live because youll die very soon kind of vibe? yeah? art is just one distraction for your boring short life in a way. yeah? yeah,0

But I walked into a room, and there was a Rothko next to a wonderful sea view. I stood for about 5 minutes, staring, falling into the view and the work. I have always loved Rothko, and only know a bit about the artist and intention. Sometimes where the art is, is the meaning.",0

"Art is not meaningless but I don&#39;t think art has meaning that can be conveyed with words. Well, some art do, but not all. Also, your opening statement was about a movie but rest of the video is about paintings. Different forms of art. Movies are stories, i.e. words. Even silent films had screenplays written with words. Although an argument can be made about the screenplays for silent films having only instructions and descriptors instead of a story. Anyway, that&#39;s beside the point. The bottomline, in my opinion, is I don&#39;t think that art - especially modern art - has meaning that needs to be, can be, nor should be expressed in words. I think a painting needs to be felt, not read nor understood. Because if the painter wanted to tell a story, they could&#39;ve just wrote it (again, some art do tell a story, and thus have a &quot;meaning&quot; - like most romantic paintings for example - but I&#39;m primarily talking about modern art).",0

"Hi Abigail!I wanted to suggest you a topic for a video.It would be about “why don’t people want to understand?”. What i mean is, it is about people who simply refuse to actually understand or learn based on evidence for X or Y topic. They “block their hears” when confronted with evidence that contradict their personal beliefs on something. They would rather ignore the evidence and continue living in their own “bubble”. They feel more comfort mentally when denying everything.",0

i love u and the way u say &quot;Urinal&quot;,0
"My own take is that art is a study in the futility of words to capture the essence of change over time :3Where language fails, art begins ^^The reason being:Unlike maths with things like derivatives, you can’t exactly capture the exact form of one’s thought process in a coherent, digestible way. Closest we really have to my knowledge is Ulysses.Instead of a line or curve, we can only create scatter plots and timelines of what an artist may have been thinking over time. To fully understand how and why an art piece may have been made we would need the entire context in which an artist lived their life as well as how history may have morphed its meaning over time. It is impossible to predict in just one lifetime, for taking something that complex apart and understanding it often takes longer to figure out than the time that was spent creating it in the first place.",0
"Good luck with the play. Make sure that when you break a leg its on stage, not before then pull a Dave Grohl.",0

"I work in a museum, and we have a lot of Rothko&#39;s; I really don&#39;t connect with them at all, but a few years ago I read his book THE ARTIST&#39;S REALITY: Philosophies of Art (published posthumously, edited by his son) which I did really connect with. Interesting, too, is how curators play into interpretation a lot - in the first few yeas of working here we had a wood sculpture, which I loved, and one day while in that gallery I met the artist, and we discussed his piece; he had a lot of uncertainty about the political aspects attached to his piece by a curator on the title card, which was not in his intention.",0

"I first became a songwriter as a way to process the emotions generated by various personal experiences.  However, I quickly became aware that many of those experiences (and resulting emotions) are largely universal.  Realizing that, my goal now is for others to understand me, while hopefully helping others to feel feel understood, too.  In fact, I specifically avoid the use of proper nouns, places, or pop culture references, so my lyrics remain as universally accessible and timeless as possible.  People who know me may hear my songs and understand exactly what they mean; others will understand my art in more general terms, based on their experiences.  Both are correct because I want listeners to bring their own baggage.Then again, I have written a song in which the lyrics are all metaphorical, telling a perfectly coherent story on their own, while actually being about something entirely different. In Blues, it&#39;s called, &quot;Signifying.&quot;  The thing is, the way I wrote it, most people interpret it one way, which I intended, but only one listener has perceived the true meaning, which hides one layer deeper.",0

"Dah of course it isIts all just playPlay of the mind, play of the emotions playing with the experience of sight sound or touch.

"I am highly sceptical of &quot;meaning and purpose&quot;.  First it is often difficult to find, often because there is NO meaning and purpose to something. Second, it feeds into a religious morality. &quot;You MUST do this or DON&quot;T do that, because god&quot;. We tend to personalise everything: &quot;god and evil&quot; especially. Even working out function can be challenging enough. What drove biological evolution? people puzzled for many centuries before Darwin and Wallace worked out a testable mechanism. This was partly because people jumped to &quot;purpose&quot; before working out how function came about. The &quot;god-creator&quot; idea was never really a good one, because it degenerated into endless speculation. Was god infinite in space and time? Who created the &quot;creator-god&quot;, and other unanswerable questions. Worse, they were UNTESTABLE questions. And it is not as if we couldn&#39;t come up with a decent moral system without a god or religious tradition. Just based on facts. We are [for the most part] cognitive social apes that can detect, and relate to, sufferings in others. So to have a functional and safe society, things like violence and murder are dysfunctional for individuals, and societies. And are you a moral agent, if you just refrain from murdering someone because some &quot;magic man in the sky is going to punish or reward you based on your behaviours?&quot;&quot;Purpose&quot;, even in biology, is highly suspect. There are males and females, is the purpose of genitals for reproduction? Yes, mating can be a function that promotes the creation of offspring, but humans and other organism use sex for all sorts of things. And they all seem to get by somehow by having homosexual, bisexual or whatever behaviours from time to time. &quot;Symptoms&quot; get conflated with &quot;causes&quot;.  Why not accept sex and gender as something that &quot;just is&quot;. ? But no, if someone is &quot;non-binary&quot; the &quot;sex is just for reproduction&quot; [function] means that those who do not indulge in sex for reproduction are, at best, seen as &quot;dysfunctional&quot;, and at worst, evil, and something to be abused or destroyed. So, at least 99% of the time, &quot;purpose and meaning&quot; is not only horseshit, but harmful horseshit. My two cents anyway.",0

"&quot;Is art meaningless&quot; would be a stupid question if it wasn&#39;t actually a tactically destructive question use to waste people&#39; s time. But that tactic is to be expected of a post 1945 culture of endless faux-rebel newbie Dadaist that infest the world with their fear of definite choices.People who ask this question: are people who want art to have no meaning, or a single meaning that stable exists through out all time. They are also people who hate history and context and thinking Art Suffers from an abidance of meaning.Art Suffers from an abidance of meaning.Art Suffers from an abidance of meaning.That is why all people who make art can&#39;t really talk about it. It is because they want to maximize the work&#39;s ability to keep people thinking about it. There was a meme about a person complaining about how people shouldn&#39;t discuss the colour of the curtains. Yet in the bible, god dictate the detail what color the dressing of the tabernacle should be.People when they like an art work will find huge amount of meaning in the smallest things.Or at least what they interpret as &quot;small things&quot; because people who hate history don&#39;t understand how one colours could have tons of meanings. Such as flags, royalty clothing, sports teams and bodily fluids. It is not so much &quot;does art have meaning,&quot; but which groups subscribe what meaning to a work.A correct meaning is nothing more than having a group of people agree with that meaning. And when different groups have different meanings they have to gibberish up their meaning to make sure they don&#39;t go to war.This is why reality is slippery.  It&#39;s a collection of meanings the come from certain groups. Ultimate the meanings of art are boring, and really it&#39;s the group that creates the meaning, and if a person knows a group well enough, then one can predict their boring reactions.Much how the use of Picasso was miss-read. The people didn&#39;t have two mouths; they would have one mouth to the side and the eyes looked straight at the viewer. The goal of cubeism was to present different perspectives at the same time on a 2d plane The Curtains were purple. Those with access to history know that purple was a very hard colour to make, which why it represented royalty.",0
"So I think the artists intent is not so important, more over I&#39;d say you can somewhat objectively, if only for a time, determine if art is good or bad. I&#39;d say when 1,000 people look, feel, or experience art in its many forms, and most come to the same conclusion, that is objectively good art, even if the consensus is that it&#39;s bad. When they come to many different conclusions I&#39;d say its bad art.Edit: I&#39;d like to debate this idea.",0

The viewer&#39;s interpretation is as valid as the author&#39;s, and maybe even more. As an artist I&#39;m glad when the viewer sees something inentented in my paintings. If it means something to them, whatever this is, then I did my job well. Meanings and feelings is the number one reason for a sale, not the objective &quot;quality&quot; / level of technique / hours I put in.",0

"I think art often(Not always) is made with some sort of intention or opinion. Certainly, I know that you can probably gleam more than a few of my opinions from my writings. But it still leaves room for interpretation. I know some pieces of media that I dislike, even though they are popular, and it would be arrogant to claim that I know better than all those people, yet it also feels wrong to say that my interpretation is wrong.",0

"As I Fine Art graduate my experience of art galleries is sometimes tainted by every stupid thing I said and did at uni and every stupid life and career choice I&#39;ve made since. I love making art, but the frame of mind I bring to viewing other people&#39;s art really does change what I get from it. If I didn&#39;t know that before, I definitely know it now.  But I think the best art either almost makes you forget that it is art, makes you forget about yourself, or makes you so immersed in it that you can&#39;t, or don&#39;t want to, hold another thought at the same time. It puts you on a constructive or a cathartic path, whether you know if you get it or not, you get something from it.",0
"A former roommate of mine and I talked once about the Rothko Chapel, where several gigantic paintings of his hang in a largely empty space meant to be a non-denominational chapel where people can come to meditate and pray.

You are inspirational.I&#39;m a songwriter and poet and my view has always been that each song or poem should mean whatever the reader or listener deems it to.

"I like the indeterminacy argument towards the singular. The artist may denote their meaning on it and may grow to develop a new meaning as years go on. This is the same with the general publics reaction to it. A lot of the context is lost and too intellectualised which is why Sontag&#39;s remark about just experiencing the art has a significant weight. This also brings in the indeterminacy of the individuals ideas, aesthetics and conceptual analysis of what we mean by &quot;meaning&quot;. If it is contextual then the artist saying it is x means it is x. Postmodern art theory showed it was more about what the audience wants it to mean. (Barthes - killing the author - giving rise to postmodern critiques) The immeasurable wealth of what Rothko means to the person is weighed against what he said it does. Art does let people interpret new things, and it always will. Meaning is not value.",0

"i love art. it can appear so useless. but it can also change your view of the world. or document ideas of time periods. but i mostly interact with art by looking at it. i don’t think or try to interpret it, i look at it.but it‘s fun to try to interpret it, so i sometimes do that too. but for me, the first is an inherently ‚alone‘ experience and interpreting is more fun doing with more than one person. i don‘t really care what the artist intended. i think the moment the artist shares it, they have lost the right for the right interpretation. so sometimes i read what the artist intended, so that the artist can ‚be that second person with whom you interpret it‘. but i don’t give their interpretation any more weight than anyone elses interpretation. i think you can also learn a lot about the person you are looking at the art with, by listening to their interpretation, and that‘s always interesting. i also love looking at things that weren’t ‚intended‘ to be art. i think everything can be art and i like seeing the world as art. i also think it’s a pity when people say they know ‚the right interpretation‘ because they loose so many interesting thoughts that way.",0

"George A. Romero&#39;s Night of the Living Dead is the first zombie movie, released in 68&#39;, only four years after the civil rights act. The plot is simple. The dead suddenly come back and crave the flesh of the living, and various survivors barricade themselves in a remote house, but the numbers of the undead around the house are constantly increasing and tensions between the survivors are rising. In the end, only our main character remains alive. Ben; risking his life for others on multiple occasions and standing up to a toxic, cowardly and authoritarian wife beater throughout the movie. A group of previously introduced armed guys led by a mayor hunting for zombies approach the house. Ben heard gunshots and looks out the window, assuming rescue is here. &quot;There is one&quot; one of the men says, pointing at Ben. A few seconds later, Ben falls to the ground, he&#39;s been shot in the head. &quot;That&#39;s another one for the pile&quot; they say, and use meat hooks to drag his body to be burned together with dozens of zombie corpses.Ben is played by a black man. Romero said that he didn&#39;t intend any racial themes while writing, Duane Jones, Ben&#39;s actor, simply gave the best performance at the auditions. Some art can speak on it&#39;s own.",0

"So glad you featured Rothko’s Seagram Murals. They are particularly challenging. I’ve always subscribed to James Joyce’s ideas on art as expressed by his character Stephen Daedalus in The Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man; “—In the same way, said Stephen, your flesh responded to the stimulus of a naked statue, but it was, I say, simply a reflex action of the nerves. Beauty expressed by the artist cannot awaken in us an emotion which is kinetic or a sensation which is purely physical. It awakens, or ought to awaken, or induces, or ought to induce, an esthetic stasis, an ideal pity or an ideal terror, a stasis called forth, prolonged, and at last dissolved by what I call the rhythm of beauty.” For me, it is that aesthetic stasis, that suspended apprehension which bypasses the intellect and it’s need to interpret art that is essential. The Seagram Murals provide that. Sit with them, contemplate them, don’t try and interpret or make sense of them and they’ll open to you.",0
"People that use air quotes tickle me because they make me think they are doltish but in your case it is funny because you are being sarcastic, ironic and most of all mean with the best of intentionality. Anyways in art all is possible. Intentionality at best ends being an icberg frozen in time and space but as time itself ages the art and kills of the artist intentionality becomes a mean of erasing what is the true nature of artistic expression. David Mamet intentiuonality is that of an angry Jew who wants to get even with the inhumanity that surrounds his petty second rate Jordan Peterson (and Jordan Petersen is third rate to begin with which is as close a compliment that Mamet deserves). What matters in art is serendipity. Not just in the act of creation by the artist but in its &#39;interpretation appreciation and denounciation&#39; by those that would do so. Rothko to me is just a suicidal hot mess that wanted to get under peoples skin by depressing the fuck out of them. Most artist are outsiders with a chip on their shoulder or unresolved traumas and irreconcialable hatreds and unattainable loves. So they toil in the making and as they make serendipidously truth beauty emerges. Thanks for making think about what the hell i am doing making art for. It is not for the money nor for the reknown or to even get laid, the doing somehow has all of those rewarding our souls in an &quot;abstract expressionistic&#39; manner that has me completely unawares of what the hell I am talking about. All human beings now have only one choice and that is to become as great an artist as one is able to and all of us must do our best to see all of it and bear it witness. To do less dooms us to an extinction of the soul, culture and raison d&#39;etre. I wonder if I can now use airquotes as my mantra? If I gesture airquotes while asking if a tree falls down in the forrest does it make a sound, will the airquotes make its own swishy sound? Anyways congradulations with your lesbianism and yes I would like to watch that sometime in a post modernist sort of way. It&#39;s a conceptual artsy fartsy fetish most artist tend to have and all too often are severely judged for being.",0
"In English, one assignment we had was to analyze two works about the same place, one by an artist, one by a scientist, we weren&#39;t told that, I assumed the one by a poet was some dry science thing, and found the one by the science guy a fun and interesting piece of art",0
"Art is a really fun topic! I think it is honestly great to &quot;misinterpret&quot; a work of art, to find different ways it could be read based on what exists in the work itself. It&#39;s very fun to hold multiple ideas to be true about a work of art. My favorite example of this is Icon For Hire&#39;s &quot;Supposed to Be&quot;, much of their discography revolves around struggle with mental illness and &quot;Supposed to Be&quot; is about the anxiety of navigating identity when recovering from mental illness as it takes up so much of your identity that one can feel naked without it. However mental illness in the work can be substituted with dysphoria, where many people view gender dysphoria as the basis of their transness and worry about who they are without it.Art is also driven by audiences, what a person thinks about it is just as important as what an author &quot;intends&quot; (which is in itself their own interpretation of the work). It is also impossible to account for every possible viewer and their experiences that changes the meaning of the artwork to themself.",0
disagree,0
"This was a great video, and I’ve always thought art interpretation is very interesting, because from my perspective I’m always far more interested in what others think my art is about than what I think. I can’t speak for other artists but most of the time I get an image in my head or in a dream and then I make it real, in that sense, I almost need other people to explain my art to me. It has always been my opinion that most art is autobiographical and speaks to the life the artist lived when they created it. As artist we can try imbuing meaning in our work but ultimately it’s just another way of trying to communicate. When I first got into art it was because if felt like their were things I couldn’t say or verbalize, I’d spent my life trying to become as articulate as possible but no matter how precisely you convey your opinion or experience, that will always be filtered through the lens’s of other peoples experience. To me the first time I really started making art it felt like I was able to say the things that I always wanted to with the freedom of not worrying if other people “got” me. That’s what makes art so beautiful to me, the freedom of expression and the balance of interpretation",0

"I’m big into hiking. When I get to a vantage where I can see the landscape around me, I’m often struck by the aesthetic experience, as I might be by a work of art. The colors and textures and sound and air, are all very powerful to me. They mean something to me, something about life as a force, and the beauty of harmony in a complex system, and the true scale of space and time in the universe that humanity is embedded in like a splinter. At the same time, I’m very aware that there is no intention present in the landscape, no artist. This is just what the world looks like, and has always looked like, since long before artistic intent existed here. Or perhaps, the universe as a whole is the artist. I often find myself comparing my experiences of human art to this one, and tend to see a lot of art through this comparison. I don’t think I have anything special to conclude from this, except that I think art can be everything you said in the video and even more. I don’t generally worry about “getting it”, except as a medium of understanding between me and someone I care about. To me, art is an iceberg, and there is no way for a single human to perceive or understand it entirely. Art is a part of us, as we are a part of it, and no system can describe and justify its own existence.",0

When Fearless Girl was erected on Wall Street in juxtaposition to the pre existing Charging Bull statue, it could be interpreted as a feminist statement against patriarchy. But the sculptor of Charging Bull was understandably angry because it changed the meaning of his statue, originally meant as a sign of America’s resilience, to one embodying sexism. But then there’s the extra complication that Fearless Girl was commissioned by a trillion dollar Wall Street Index fund that explicitly advertises the company, whereas charging bull was an act of guerilla art that the artist (an immigrant) never sold, in some ways making the fearless girl more of an expression of capitalist priceless than the bull.",0
"I have my own view on an artwork&#39;s meaning.Art is a process. That process may or may not have an intended direction or destination, however it is influenced by the experiences and thought processes of the artist.

It is through one&#39;s own understanding of the world that we find meaning.Anyone can share their own interpretation, even the artist. Some seek comfort in knowing theirs is the same.

"RE meaning, intention, and the subjective experience (and how the external social experience affects them), from the perspective of an Opera-majored Music &amp; Linguistics double-degreed viewer:  The final moments of Act IV of Mozart&#39;s The Marriage of Figaro are written on the page as a woman conferring forgiveness upon her cheating husband. However, there are aspects of both the objective writing and the subjective interpretation by the director of production (which are well-known to scholars of this masterwork, so much so that it&#39;s near standardized, expected in production) that are...seem....clear indications that this moment is really one of God/deity conferring forgiveness upon the human animal. The expectation of knowledge of this subjective interpretation is so great that there&#39;s an additional expectation upon the producer/director of creating that subjective experience, and a failure to do so is a kind of social malpractice because it strips the work of its (expected) meaning. EX: In one of my experiences of viewing the opera (after having studied and performed in it and seen it produced by exceptional companies), I saw a production by a smaller company with a less-educated audience (NB: By this I mean that there was no output by the company, no lectures nor programs for the audience), in which the director ignored or was unaware of the known interpretation (or did something intentional that was cruel, even emotionally abusive), and this seemed a dereliction (or willful malfeasance) of duty to the creation of the piece that adhered to its true meaning:  In Act II, in the middle of a brilliant and hilarious dispute, the Count asks forgiveness for his actions from his wife. Here, the director arranged a series of events in which the Count finally knelt down in a certain way to do this; it was funny; it should have been (if we read Mozart&#39;s work on the page, which are more objective at this moment in the opera). But in the more profound moment at the end of Act IV  (by subjective opinion, albeit an agreed-upon one), in which the moment was coming, and the music was predicting this moment (there is a written rest, a silence, and in that moment, the direction is for the Count to kneel), I had opened myself up for that spiritual experience, the forgiveness, but the director had chosen for the Count kneel down before the Countess in the exact way he had in Act II...and the audience laughed; where forgiveness should have been, there was laughter. In that moment, in which the socially-agreed-upon, expected interpretation of this work of art was altered by the director...I felt violated...because my subjective experience of the art was something so expected, and the director, intentional or not, turned it into something else. Here, while my subjective experience of a work of art is my own, my interpretation is the widely-accepted and educated one, and the interpretation of a director/producer of the art was not only contradictory, but contradictory in a way that defied what objective clues we have from the written work and the social agreement about the meaning of that moment, so that the director&#39;s interpretation was emotionally and spiritually harmful. There was a social responsibility that the director violated by, intentionally or not, mis-/re-interpreting that moment. Here, meaning, and the social agreement about meaning where objective evidence might be lacking, was part of the social experience of the art.",0
"I&#39;m an illustrator and writer. I went to an arts university focused on conceptual art, and hated it. We learned nothing, very few teachers were competent and we were doing all the time trash because they didn&#39;t teach us any technique or skill. We had a teacher that literally made us do a sculpture project with trash, I had another sculpture teacher that didn&#39;t let me do any figurative project because she didn&#39;t know anatomy sho she couldn&#39;t correct any mistakes if there were.I made a lot of shit and learned to &quot;sell &quot; it by adding some made up phylosophical nonsense about the hidden meaning of the piece (and I love phylosophy but it was nonsense, and teachers liked it).There are some conceptual art I can like for pure aesthetic or as a curiosity, but as an artist, to me most of it is just made-up pretentious hollow nonsense to sell. I got really tired of all that world and turned into fantasy illustration, at least with my art I know I don&#39;t need to sell a point, I just want to tell stories and that is all.Loved the video btw :)",0
"a lot of stuff people have made over the years that is legitamately considered art...is pure trash.  eye of the beholder I suppose.The fella that lays his cavas on the ground and spins it round and round as a paint can pendulum swings overhead with a hole in it...I cannot consider art...anymore than I consider painting a house as art.  He has made some pretty stuff, but hardly worth 30k a painting.  He can literally crank out dozens a day.  It is absurd.  BUT, art and pretty things means completely different things to different people...",0

"There&#39;s a song from Joan Manuel Serrat called &quot;princesa&quot;. It&#39;s about a mother who worries about her daughter because she wants her to have a better life than she had. It&#39;s sang from the pov of the mother, who tells her child that she must be well behaved and well dressed, and that she must refrain from hanging out with the other girls and boys in town, who have no aspirations and will must probably end up as poor as their parents. The song ends with the daughter leaving the house for an audition for a tv show.My boss showed me this song and expressed that he felt the song was heartwarming, because it showed the love of the mother towards her daughter. I, on the contrary, felt it was heartbreaking, because this woman puts so much pressure on her daughter and even alienates her from her friends, only for the expectation that she will have a career as an actress. All this without knowing that the TV and film industries are very exploitative and that incoming actresses have to go through an immense amount of sexual harassment and abuse to get their first role.I don&#39;t know what the author&#39;s intention was, but the artwork touched me and my boss in very different ways. Maybe the point of art is not to &quot;get it&quot;, but to feel it. It is not the artwork itself what&#39;s valuable, but the interaction between it and us, even between it and the author. The whole is greater than the sum of the parts.",0

"I always think the song Hotel Expressionism by The Streets actually has something mildly profound to say on the 3rd part of the video.&quot;Hotel Expressionism is its own form of art, because with normal art someone that&#39;s usually the artist they pour out their heart, but it&#39;s worth is decided by committee and has to obey the law of the sharks. Hotel expressionists walk out the lift and on checking out pay for their art.&quot;The song is talking about vandalising hotel rooms in unique and creative ways, but it considers this to be a very pure form of art as you&#39;re not interested in its worth; the cost of the art can be easily calculated from the damage caused. It helps that the song slaps too.",0
"Ok so fun anecdote: it&#39;s 2010, my mother and I are visiting London and decide to each take a day on our own. I decide I&#39;m going to go to both Tates via boat. I&#39;m 20 and have had visceral reactions to Rothko every time I&#39;ve seen his work prior, so I&#39;m kinda stoked for the Rothko room you go in here. And I feel, frankly, little. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s bad or bullshit or anything but it just isn&#39;t bringing anything out of me except a vague sense of defeat and I start to worry that that is the point when two older and extremely English women come in.They observe these massive color fields, and despite my assumptions they do not sneer, they don&#39;t scoff, instead they give small nods and thoughtful exhales. At the last one, one turns to the other and loudly says in a slightly northern accent, &quot;well, that&#39;s art for ya&quot;This sentence will never leave me. I have so many questions.",0
I have to say I really like the idea of a piece of art that does immediately make anyone looking at it need to pee.,0
"What if we took Rothko&#39;s paintings and display them in a large room, away from the floor, on bright white walls with strong lighting? It would certainly creat a dramatic affect, and change the art work&#39;s emotional impact on the viewer. Will it also change its meaning? Will it, in effect, creat a new art work? If someone produces Shakespeare&#39;s The Merchant of Venice with Shylock as the pov protagonist - are they still &quot;doing Shakespear&quot;? Or are they commenting on it with something new?",0
"pog video. the thing that interests me that i feel is left out is what the viewer(s) of art brings to the experience.  one might decide that the best way to experience rothko is to empty your mind of other thoughts and focus on the colours and perhaps that is what you are invited to do by the gallery. but it&#39;s a choice your making and there are other choices too, as the video details. If an artwork itself has meaning, then so too must the lens of interpretation through which the work is experienced. but that means there is something in the &quot;value&quot; or &quot;meaning&quot; or &quot;interpretation&quot; of art that  does not reside in the artwork alone, nor in the viewer&#39;s subjective experience, but which emerges as part of this dialectic working out.this sounds like wankery but honestly I think it&#39;s actually pretty intuitive when we actually engage with art. when I sit down to watch 3 hours of shakespeare I&#39;m alert to different aspects of the experience than i would be if I was watching 3 hours of marvels avengers. I decide I can get the most out of avengers by drinking 5 beers and going &quot;ooh&quot; and &quot;aah&quot; when hulk smashes. For Macbeth I&#39;m more attentive to the use of language and the performances of the actors. My choices here are influenced by the content of the works, but do not pass judgment on it. And similarly, the content is produced under the assumption that it can be judged in certain such ways. I guess another way to put it would be to say that it&#39;s a like dialogue between the artwork and the viewer. And they don&#39;t necessarily speak the same languages. And translating between languages may cause divergences in the conversation. Or it may break down entirely. You might think the artwork is asking you &quot;how are you feeling?&quot; or &quot;would you like to see hulk smash?&quot; or &quot;What if there were too many genders?&quot; and depending on the artwork in question you may be satisfied or not. But depending on the artwork, you also intuit that some questions are more apposite than others. Does this mean there is no &quot;correct&quot; meaning/interpretation of art? yes i think so - since it is ultimately rooted in the subjective experience of the individual, the scope of meaning that can reside solely in the artwork itself is as untamed as human experience. But that doesn&#39;t mean that any meanings you find are entirely arbitrary or inexplicable. That feeling that an interpretation is &quot;wrong&quot; doesn&#39;t make sense in reference to the artwork alone, but it might make sense in the wider scope of socially constructed meanings that you perceive it to belong to. You can have any heterodox interpretation you like, and if you find it to be valuable then more power to you, but if you want to take your experience and share it then you will need to have some means of communicating that - a communication that would probably break down into confusion if you tried something like reviewing Dr Strange as if it was actually Titanic. But by the same token, I think any entirely personal reason you have for valuing an artwork (like there being a nice reminder of alfred molina) is a valid part of the experience and shouldn&#39;t be entirely discounted. I don&#39;t know which philosophers this view aligns with, but I&#39;m definitely of the opinion that worrying about the objective meaning of an artwork only really makes sense if you have a constrained view of what the actual process of experiencing art is.",0

"I’ll just throw in my two cents. Is “meaning” an intrinsic attribute of art? Or rather, should it be?It seems to me that the main criticism of modern art is the fact that it bases its value (let’s call it that) on meaning rather than its objective beauty (or lack thereof).If you look back on other artistic periods, for example neoclassicism, they took inspiration from Greek and Roman art not because it had some meaning, but because it was beautiful. Sure, they attributed certain values like reason and enlightenment to the art, but the main reason they copied Greek and Roman art mainly because of their beauty. So one could argue that neoclassical art had meaning because it was beautiful, whereas modern art presents itself as being beautiful because it has meaning.I think you can’t base art on meaning, you must base its meaning on the art itself.I’m not a Marxist, I don’t agree with Marx on most things, but I will allow myself to use some of his philosophy to make a point. One of the criticisms Marx had towards his teacher Hegel was that Hegelian philosophy was based on the assumption that the world was a manifestation (or antithesis) of an idea or spirit (or thesis). Marx refuted this because according to him, reality could not simply be born out of some mystical idea. Only the real, physical world is real, and one can’t consider an abstract world as real.If we apply this concept to art, we find that the intention or idea of an artist simply cannot be considered art, because ideas are abstract. Only the work itself is concrete and thus real, so any meaning is subjective and by Marxist philosophy not admitted.If you read Paul Valery’s treaty on artistic creation, he says that “art is nothing more than a thing in itself”, and that a good reading of the art can improve the quality of a poor product and vice versa.If art bases its value on meaning, it means that the “work of art” doesn’t exist in itself but rather in the head of who’s observing it, and the art disappears once the viewer moves their attention away from it; viceversa, a work of art done for the sake of beauty (or art that claims to have value not because of its meaning but simply because of it’s physical self) exists irrespective of its viewer.The former will cease to exist once the mentality of people changes, whereas the latter will stand the test of time.“The fountain” will cease to exist as a work of art if enough people stop thinking of it as a work of art and see it as a simple urinal, they will throw it away, whereas no matter how much the mentality of a society changes, “The Birth of Venus” will still be a beautiful painting of a woman on a seashell being given life by an angel, “Amor and Psyche” will still be a romantic depiction of two bodies kissing.Which brings me to another and final point.Modern art, or rather art that bases itself on meaning rather than physical beauty, is also based on elitism and classism. If you must know the meaning of a work of art to appreciate it, you have to follow a specific school of thought, meaning that those who do not follow said school of thought are excluded from that work. And maybe you can’t follow that school of thought because you don’t have the time or resources to inform yourself about it, so now that art is just an inside joke of a small, elitist (and sometimes condescending) circle. Art that bases itself on its physical beauty, however, is open to everyone and anyone, as it is an immediate message that does not require any particular education.",0

"I took AP art in high school concentrating on insects. I showed off my work in my schools annual public art show, and a little kid said something I still think about when he looked at my pieces. “It’s like you live in a giant world!”My intention of my concentration was to lessen the fear of insects by bringing them up close in a way that the audience could feel safe (as opposed to showing live insects). I didn’t mean to make him feel small like that, but that was out of my control. And his comment brain blasted me and made me feel the same way because I really do live on in an unimaginably big world filled with creatures I’ll never get to see anywhere but in pictures.",0

"When I look at that red painting with the black lines I just feel… bored? Maybe a little confused. Sometimes wonder if I’m just missing the part of my brain that makes me capable of enjoying really abstract pieces of art? I guess it really depends on the specific work but most of them leave me feeling.. Indifferent? And that’s not because I’ve resigned myself to believing “it’s not real art” and starting out with the goal of disliking it. I want to get it and see what I’m missing, but I just don’t get anywhere. There was that one scientific study that compared abstract paintings and paint throw at a canvas by Chimpanzees that found the majority of people could tell the difference. I must be one of those who can’t. Recently I visited the Louvre, and I saw countless pieces of expertly made, beautiful art.. But there were only three works that actually made me feel anything other than “oh, that’s cool.” The first was the palace of King Darius I, which doesn’t count because I was just filled with the kind of excitement youd get when meeting a celebrity, as I had read about him for a history paper. The second was a painting of a man who was holding his dead wife after returning from exile, and the artist captured the shock, grief, and loss in his eyes in a way that it made me those things too. But that wasn’t abstract, so that doesn’t really count either. There was one piece, that was hanging above a staircase, that’s the only abstract art that’s ever made me feel before. It was a silhouette of a person, almost like an aura, laying in the dirt while staring up at the night sky full of stars. It made me feel wonder, but at the same time weirdly trapped? Like there was all this beauty out there in the world, but like the figure I was just stuck in the dirt, doomed to watch it from a distance. It captured that mixture of awe and nihilistic dread you get when you think about yourself in relation to the scale of the universe - there’s all that out there, and you’re just dirt. I still wonder why that one connected with me when all these other works just make me think “Ooh, those are fun squiggly blue lines”.",0
"wild that most people see the seagram murals as sad. to me they&#39;re objects of bloodthirst and danger, looking at an angry gorilla through thick glass. the only reason the canvas has not torn itself from the wall, folded to razor sharp ribbons, and mangled me, is that the laws of physics constrain it.",0
"What do you think about religion as art with an imperative for interpretation?Your video reminded me of Jesus; His parables are an absolute art, that he said had specific meaning that would only be known to a select few... and yet, Christians have been going to war for millennia against those with a different interpretation.

"the doctor strange opening argument is quite flawed. Not to be a dick but missing the plot and missing the meaning are not the same. The plot and what its about is not subjective, the meaning behind it and what the moral is, is.what you did was the equivalent of going to a red painting and then telling your friend &quot;it was the best green painting ive ever seen&quot;. You stated something that is objectively wrong.Now ,if you were asked &quot;whats the message, whats the point&quot; you could say nearly anything and be right ad also wrong. Art is subjective, the meaning and take away can be anything.(which to be fair, you kind of went into in the second part)",0
"unless if it has some practical or medicinal use, art is meaningless.",0
"The same high quality and fantastic discussion as always, thank you Abigail. Still, one thing I had expected you to discuss but didn&#39;t see was the extent to which a lot of art, especially modern art, is part of a conversation between artists. To an extent, we are interlopers listening to an exchange to which we are only incidentally involved. My favourite example is to consider how to interpret René Magritte&#39;s &quot;Perspective II, Manet&#39;s Balcony&quot;, if you were not familiar with Manet&#39;s &quot;The Balcony&quot; first. Of course this also applies very explicitly to Duchamp&#39;s Fountain that you discuss in the video.",0
"The strange thing about meaning is, it&#39;s at the same time subjective and objective. You are born into a world where words are defined in a dictonary, and you have to adopt them. Then again you are using language to express your needs, feelings and desires. I think by interpreting art you cannot get to a place, where everything is resolved, every single tension realeased. There will always be a certain doubt, but that doesn&#39;t mean that you can&#39;t approach this place.",0
"Beautiful work, Abby. I think this one is a new fave for me",0
No it&#39;s not meaningless. Not inherently. Art is expression and storytelling and everything that enriches our lives somehow without needing to be &quot;useful&quot;,0
"I really needed this kind of exploration. I&#39;m finally getting the first opportunity as a painter to create something special in a long time, but so removed and lost from that world that I can&#39;t think up a concept. Of all things to get the conceptual mind flowing, I actually went straight to your back log of philosophy content that has taught me so much over the years, and seemingly by fate you put out this piece specifically about philosophising art. You have immeasurably helped an artist today Abi, keep up the amazing work you do 💙",0
"So this is gonna be my take on the title before I watch the video, and I&#39;ll come back to it when I finish the vid. If you&#39;re reading the Abigail, the video is probably very well made and brings up some important points I didn&#39;t consider. So anyway I think that art is only meaningless if you decide that it should be so. What I mean by that is a piece of art can have very wildly different meanings depending on who it reaches and the person who is viewing the art. For example, one person can look at a song and recognize very deep themes about mental illness and about child abuse or neglect, and another can hear the same song and simply think &quot;oh hey, Pumped Up Kicks is pretty catchy, let&#39;s put that on our school radio show&quot;. I think that a piece of art can be made with the express purpose of delivering one message, and can transform into new life as time passes and a variety of people all look at it and express their individual thoughts about it, sort of how people take cartoon characters and turn them into lgbt icons. An important caveat to this though is that because a piece of art can mean different things to different people, a piece of art can easily be weaponized against certain groups in society, even if the piece of art itself is originally unrelated to the oppressive movement. However, the piece of art itself does not do anything on it&#39;s own, other than be perceived, interpreted, and shared by people. In conclusion to this super informal essay, what I&#39;m trying to say is that a piece of art only has meaning when you the individual ascribes meaning to it, and you the individual will always be free to simply avoid giving art meaning or to delve as deeply into a piece of art and it&#39;s history and potential meaning as you wish, so long as you are respectful of other people&#39;s ability to do the same. Thanks for coming to my TED talk.Edit: aight I watched the video and I was right, lots of very important discussion here I&#39;d say. The part about that artist who admitted he was a fraud and then went into nfts was pretty ironic, and art as a vehicle for wealth totally slipped past me when I was originally formulating my thoughts on the subject. I tried to limit how much I touched on artist intention myself, because whole I think that the intent of the author definitely shapes the way that art is perceived, in the sense that the author gives you the stimulus from which your brain makes connections, the author still does not have complete control over how an audience can or will experience it. To use a mixed up metaphor, you can paint a wall green, but you can&#39;t keep a colorblind person from seeing red. One thing I noticed was that there is a distinction between what a piece of art is about and the meaning of the art? Like, if you were to interpret the meaning of art to be the lesson that you take away from it, or the message that the art conveys/ is meant to convey (augh, im contradicting myself. Hear me out, I have a good point in here somewhere) In that case, you would say that Titanic was about some people on a boat that find love and have it be abruptly interrupted by an iceberg, but the meaning of it would be that &quot;the greatest moments of our lives are often fleeting and don&#39;t last for very long, so enjoy them while they last and live in the present, not the past&quot; or something like that. Anyway, great video Abby, your costumes are great and your punchlines were greater. Keep up the good work!",0

"&quot;Rothko said he wanted his audience to feel trapped.&quot;Rothko: &quot;Is commissioned to make an art piece where people enjoy their evening.

You can look at art and be wrong about what the artist intended to be its meaning.  But does that make you wrong about its actual meaning?  Maybe the artist is wrong about what their art actually conveys?,0

Me interpreting any piece of art differently🥴.The question is how does our (not the artist&#39;s) interpretation of art mean? And does it hold any  value outside of what they were trying to say,0

"You put into words what I&#39;ve been thinking about for some time now. As an artist I&#39;m always thinking about how to put meaning into my art, that reflects how I see things. And I was thinking, how do I put my own meaning into my art, if the meaning is subjective? It never made sense to me but now I realize that just because people interpret things subjectively it doesn&#39;t mean that the meaning itself is subjective. Love your videos, have a nice day.",0
"My greatest experience of art was seeing Rothko in London while listening to Daughters&#39; &quot;You Won&#39;t Get What You Want.&quot; I just sat there, though the whole album, and felt swallowed. By life, by the concept of existence, by the paintings and the music. I had a panic attack, but it felt profound in a way that is hard to express.",0
"In highschool, after never having taken an art class before, I joined the International Baccalaureate Art class at my school. I had started making a piece/doing research about how people &quot;poopoo&quot; artists like Rothko and Jackson Pollock and how myself and the average person doesn&#39;t &quot;get it&quot; and it can feel meaningless. But, as I began researching more about the art pieces like Rothko&#39;s, seeing how intentionally large and vast they are (which is a completely different experience from just seeing small 1 inch large pictures on Google images or in low quality print ) and began thinking more about the emotional reaction that one can experience from art, I began to understand the art more and learned to love and appreciate them.To me I think art can be seen like furniture. There&#39;s a huge spectrum that fulfills multiple purposes from mass produced works to homemade sentimental pieces, custom originals to art market million dollar pieces sold as stocks and tax loopholes. Art&#39;s meaning can be decorative, emotional, political, financial, expressive, sentimental, educational, entertainment, trendiness, aesthetic, nostalgic, ectEveryone has their own tastes, enjoys different styles, and comes with their own experiences to art. The subjective. An artist may have an explicitly clear intention with a piece, or not at all, and it&#39;s up to the viewer if they interpret the art in a common way or not. Like with furniture where forms and expectations such as a handle commonly alludes to function (such as with a drawer), one can choose the interpretation of furniture (and art&#39;s) functions. One could store clothing in an oven or make soup in a bathtub, counterintuitive to social norms and designer expectations, they are nonetheless valid as functions for the furniture&#39;s user.Like how John Green says &quot;books belong to their readers&quot;, no one person has an identical experience with art. One can learn more about the artist&#39;s intention, context and design of art works to attempt to get a closer semblance of the common interpretation the artist seeks to convey, just like how furniture can come with instruction manuals, but it&#39;s up to each individual if they choose to &quot;read the manual&quot;, how much research they plan to do for each piece, and how much they combine or ignore their individual interpretation based on the knowledge they acquire surrounding the art.",0

"There is an example I can think of where the author&#39;s intent and the actual text of a work ended up completely different from each other.Book of Mario 64 is a romhack of the original Paper Mario game that keeps the gameplay mostly unchanged, but has a completely new story. The game is set in a universe with multiple competing pantheons whose power depends on the number of adherents to their respective religions. When Browser, a deity in the religion of Kuba, discovers that he is gay and in love with Mario, despite currently being in a heterosexual marriage with the Star of Rodin, the god of Kuba, Mario is thrust into the ongoing religious conflict. The game has symbolism, one of my favorite plot twists in any piece of media, and consistent characters who develop over time. The only problem is, it was written entirely by Google Translate. Specifically, the game was made by the youtuber Fatguy706 and a team of his friends, who would take the original text from Paper Mario, translate it through various languages until the accumulated translation errors transformed the original line into something completely different, then pasted the result back into the game. If Google Translate&#39;s intent determines the game&#39;s meaning, then the plot should be read as identical to the original Paper Mario, as Google Translate&#39;s intent is to provide flawless machine translation. If you argue that the team who made the hack are the writers, then following their attempt still doesn&#39;t work, since they were trying to replicate an earlier, far more comedy-focused hack of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door that was made in a similar way, and were not trying to synchronize the lines in any way to form a story. In practice, the way the story got interpreted was like a collective version of the &quot;whatever makes it work the best for you&quot; school of art interpretation.",0

"In my high school ap art history class we read a book called “believing is seeing: creating the culture of art” by Mary Anne Staniszewinski.  The book highlighted a certain way of thinking, saying that the Mona Lisa wasnt art, but Duchamp’s version of Mona Lisa with a mustache drawn on it was.  Why?  Intention.  Mona Lisa was painted as a commissioned work, not to evoke feelings, so it wasn’t “really” art.  Nothing painted to exhibit skill, nor anything created as a cultural artifact for a purpose other than “to be art”, SHOULD be considered art.  That argument has stuck with me.  I don’t think I fully agree with it but its definitely informed my perspective.",0
"Art is self-simulation of our senses for entertainment. It is inherently masturbatory.Stroking our own emotions off. Jacking one&#39;s own imagination. Art is to abstract communication as what a date with Rosie Palms is to our physical sensory channels.Our brains are capable of communicating meaning abstractly and art exploits that capability by trying to pile on as much &quot;meaning&quot; as possible, even if that meaning is entirely fabricated and has zero relevance to reality. It&#39;s the shadows and echoes of meaning. A cascade of hypothetical questions left INTENTIONALLY unanswered - as teasing BULLSHIT like &quot;we leave this equation unsolved as an exercise for the reader&quot; yeah whatever fuck you too textbook.Then your pattern recognition and problem solving processes get to propose a bunch of potential jigsaw pieces that may hypothetically fit the gap in the puzzle WITHOUT EVER ACTUALLY COMPLETING IT because again, it&#39;s a TEASE.

"After watching this video and remembering my experiences when exposed to art, I&#39;m reaching to a conclusion, even if you didn&#39;t talk exactly about it. When I look at pictures in a museum I used to be always frustrated that next to it, it only mentions the technique, when I looked for the artist&#39;s insight. I find very attractive to feel the art, but most of the modern art works don&#39;t make me feel anything. I&#39;ve remembered some instances when I did feel things, and it was when I was given some information about the piece - apart from &quot;óleo sobre lienzo&quot; 😅. For example, there was a sculpture next to my flat, which formed kind of a huge sphere-like with a lot of gaps. It never made me feel anything. Once I had a friend visit me who knew about modern art, and she told me that it wasn&#39;t about the material in the sculpture, that it&#39;s about the space it created or something like that - it was years ago. And that made me look at it differently, it made me enjoy it for the first time. So maybe it isn&#39;t about &quot;the meaning&quot; for me, about &quot;getting it&quot;. But I still think that, in most cases, I need something more than the art work itself to be able to have some type of esthetic experience.",0
"I worked for a small town art exhibit center, back in the summer of 2020, and there was this exhibit of very beautiful porcelain sculptures upstairs. They were organic in a sort of morbid kind of way, and I definitely felt the &quot;fragility of life&quot; aspect through being constantly nervous that the visitors might break something...one of the pieces was this series of three porcelain skulls, each with a different amount of dead flowers stacked up on their heads. It was called &quot;vanities,&quot; or something like it. My boss, and many people, spent a lot of time going on at length about the meaning of the piece, and I was honestly starting to feel like it was all a bit performative and pretentious, until one day a young girl was visiting, maybe nine or ten, and she just sort of looked at the skulls, and, softly, said &quot;I think the flowers represent their thoughts,&quot; and it gave me a whole new appreciation of the work, because I&#39;d never seen it that way. No one had said that before, but once she said it, it felt obvious. It was a good, fresh take. The artist herself much preferred talking about the process of experimenting with her medium than explaining the meaning of her works, and frankly, that is very much a valid way to make art, in my opinion. Maybe the main sin of interpretation is just like the main sin of art: a refusal, conscious or unconscious, to engage in an emotionally honest attempt to express our experiences. Suggested interpretations and artist intent help us construct meaning, but at the end of the day, I think there is only ever something interesting to say about art when we feel like our experience of it, unintended as it may be, genuinely matters.",0

"As a black man, I can confirm that the play Race, hits quite a bit different. For context, I did my undergrad in history and do have a fair academic history background as a result. Additionally, one of my favorite books of all time is ‘The Storytelling Animal’ by Jonathan Gottschall. The book focuses on the question of why the otherwise ruthless process of evolution left storytelling in, since it seems ‘unnecessary’ to some thinkers. It’s not strictly utilitarian in the way other more obvious traits are.My theory is that storytelling, and art generally, is a way for a group to not only reinforce expectations about in-group behavior between members, but also control associations made between groups. Major groundwork of colonialism was made by ostensibly ‘entertainment’ products from Europeans at the time linking dark skinned peoples with tribalism, backwards thinking, and inferiority. Art here served the social function of linking European aesthetics with legitimacy, and everything else as less legitimate, inferior or unworthy. Think of projects under renewed scrutiny today like Tin Tin and the many many works like it. Through repetition and storytelling, deep associations were made and stereotypes created that made members of the in-group more attractive mates than members of the out groups. The same way you thought about Spider-Man through color association but on a larger scale with specific targets in mind.I don’t think this process requires ‘conspiracy’ or intention. People naturally want to tell stories that make them feel good about themselves or their political membership, and this sometimes has the effect of having negative results for other groups by thoughtless repetition of tropes. Sometimes it’s just the fact that the people with access to microphones write from similar perspectives that see the world in similar ways and the result is that the depiction of other groups is not considered critically. So the associations created about those other groups are often secondary considerations to the careful crafting of characters of the in-group. This makes sense to me if I think of humans as a socially advanced primate, whose tools and language allow for much more sophisticated posturing through art and storytelling. I also think that a group who has not had overwhelmingly negative perceptions created by media control might take some of these things for granted, just from lack of experience with the full potential of their effects. To them, it can just be a story.So with this theory in mind. Ask yourself why someone who looks like David Memet is comfortable portraying a black woman who actually really ‘wanted’ demeaning racist sex. The degree of sexual violence visited upon blacks is usually avoided like the plague when conversations around racial power are brought up at all. Especially in relation to its incredibly ugly reality. But this is considered titillating and intriguing to the American audience. The suggestion that she secretly wanted it. Now there are probably women like this that exist. There are many most that will find the subject repulsive and frustrating. What I’m getting at is the question ‘why would a white person be much more comfortable portraying the one in a dramatized story than even talking about the other’? What affect might this have on social perceptions? Storytelling is not as neutral as we would all like to think.",0

"I gather that Susan Sontag thinks that one should not look for meaning in art but just experience it. It seems to me that this has the corollary that if a work does not make me experience anything, I should promptly move on rather than try to wring meaning out of it. Is this implication a feature or a bug?",0
"I feel not enough regarding Madame X was said about the fact he changed the shoulder strap because that was what was considered particularly flirtatious about her, it looked like she had just come from a dalliance, showing the &#39;fixed&#39; version intended to give her modesty after the scandal has already happened, feels a bit odd. Like showing the Janet Jackson &quot;wardrobe malfunction&quot; outfit from before she got justin timberlake to bare her breast, to illustrate the scandal.  It might be still a representation of the event, but it doesn&#39;t show the reason. Also she is a finished work, a masterpiece not merely a study, there were studies done in preparation, but she is a study the same way that a memento mori is a study of life and death, I felt the way she&#39;s been talked about here feels like she was a study for the artist, and not a work which was intended for presentation in a salon, as she was. I understand that I&#39;ve never really felt the same way about art, though I have seen it from others, I take from art what I want, and give it back the same. I also find it beautiful and sad that her sister painting was never completed, perhaps because of the reception of the first, perhaps enough has been completed and the fact that her scandalous strap is missing in it&#39;s entirety really speaks to the scandal. If the strap isn&#39;t even there, then how can be it seen as perverse? The strap doesn&#39;t even need to be there on such a strongly boned garment. It can&#39;t be pulled down even if you try. The non-scandalous strap is there though, so maybe it&#39;s missing because Sargent couldn&#39;t bring himself to paint it? Perhaps he loved the delicate draping of the original strap, but if he had fixed the previous strap to try to calm the scandal does he really want to confirm it? The conspicious nature of the missing strap (it&#39;s in the tate britain if you want to pop and see it) is full of meaning in it&#39;s absence. I have studied art for quite a while, I really wish people didn&#39;t feel they have to instantly know how they feel about a piece, since I think often the history behind the art is great for the full experience, like with shakespeare. I know the language can be hard for people to understand, and I really want people to initally grasp the vibes, like the cunt joke with Malvolio in twelfth night is something I feel everyone should be able to get. It&#39;s the extra research though for people to get Toby Belch&#39;s reference to the Great Bed of Ware or know that a yard is a penis (though the context can help a bit) that I feel are things which I want people to be interested in finding out, also I wish that there was more original pronunciation of shakespeare so those rhymes hit correctly. Like there&#39;s no problem with just going &quot;That&#39;s pretty nice&quot; but like I was talking about with hogs about gorillaz, many people don&#39;t like certain gorillaz tracks until they&#39;ve had time to sit with them for a while. I&#39;m often a bit incoherent with my thoughts but I hope my ideas on this are at least something.",0

"You can&#39;t really talk about art and meaning without talking about Authorial Intent vs Death of the Author. Authorial Intent is certainly valid and necessary to factor in, but as you said artists change their intent over the course of production all the time and they often convey themes they didn&#39;t consciously intend to. Some analysts feel like they have to avoid Authorial intent at least until they&#39;ve already formed their own reading to avoid biasing their interpretation, the way they see it Authorial Intent is no more valid than any random YouTuber&#39;s reading.",0
I think that little metaphors and stuff (like the artistic stuff that makes the meaning) is supposed to be subconscious. It affects how u see the painting but not really like in a major way. And you can ignore it and enjoy the work or notice it and disect what it means (also enjoying the work),0

"I don&#39;t think the example at the start, with Dr Strange and The Titanic, shows that it&#39;s possible to look at a work of art, think you know what it means, and be wrong. Does anyone actually think that Dr Strange is about people of different social classes fining love on a doomed ocean liner? I think you could still argue that any interpretation a person has of a work of art must have /some/ validity? For it to be their interpretation of that art, it has to be based on that art in some way. Enough for you to say &quot;oh, why do you think that?&quot; not &quot;no that&#39;s a different film&quot;. In order for the examples you&#39;re giving to work, they have to be obviously wrong, and they&#39;re made up with the intent to be obviously wrong. They don&#39;t work as counterexamples because if they&#39;re not real interpretations they can&#39;t illustrate that real interpretations can be wrong. I know that in philosophy it&#39;s common to make up extreme examples to test a hypothesis but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s useful for this question.",0
"Artists are not scientists: they do not have a universally accepted method and – barring rare historical periods in particular regions – _they never have_.  Even though their creation approaches may be grouped into different tendencies, every artist creates for different reasons, so developing a universal method of interpretation is a doomed pursuit. So what do I do? I just dismiss the meaning of art I am without a way to interpret (well, if I don&#39;t have any special aesthetic draw, that is)! If I find someone who applies a critical method I hadn&#39;t or a life experience I didn&#39;t have at the time I viewed the art to draw some conclusions about certain things, then I&#39;ll learn from that, and maybe give it a second viewing. Otherwise, I generally apply a literary critical lens, adapted to a given medium I&#39;m engaging with, and if that fails, I move on.",0

But the question rises: if Charles (or Davey) is like an audience making a work that would otherwise be beautiful really all about them - is that not exactly what we&#39;d ourselves be doing, if we declare the purpose of interpretation to be the maximising of artistic value (implicitly, artistic value *to us*)?",0

"I&#39;m going to watch this later on, but right now, it&#39;s gameface time... It&#39;s action time... It&#39;s time to strike my friend.There are plenty of Russian strikes and protests happening right now.Cameron of Libertarian Communist Platform has asked me to ask others to encourage workers across the world to go on strike in solidarity with the Russian anti-war, anti-putin protests and strikes.Of course it will be up to the strikers themselves to come up with a list of concessions to be made and a plan of action, I can&#39;t do that for them.Will you boost the idea?The idea is to get those living under the boot of Putin to not be afraid to take action and strike against the invasion machine in an attempt to further disrupt it.",0
"The pretentious crap is, yes.  It prides itself on it.",0
"when it comes to art stuff, its such a complex bag I really enjoyed this video. when people talk to me about art stuff and about getting it the best way I&#39;ve found to summarise it in a sentence is. art has no right answers but there are wrong answers to what art is",0
i would argue that sometimes interpretation makes art absolutely terrifying,0
Loved the intro. by Anima!,0
Really enjoyed this long form video piece of art about lesbianism,0
WAIT HOLY SHIT I NEED EVERYONE IN THIS COMMENT SECTION TO GO WATCH A PLAYTHROUGH OF THE BEGINNERS GUIDE,0
"If the meaning of art was objective, it would not longer be art. Art doesn&#39;t invalidate the audience, it envokes it. In your attempt to defend art, you do more damage then any art critic ever could.",0
"so we are trying to get what we are trying to get ??     plus isn&#39;t it obvious that these modern art pieces are much more about the background than the what on the canvas, like why was rothko particular about the the lighting and and wall paint and the altitude of his paintings, put it next to a dumpster and the experience will definitely not be the same. post mordernist are jus background focused artist. trying to bring attention to the surroundings rather than the canvas",0
"As a fine arts major... I cackled at the zombie formalist&#39;s artist statement. This art speak is literally a different language that you learn in the art world. All that statement said was &quot;I made art violently/physically while I felt existential dread and horror.&quot; He just painted when he was upset lol.You should look at the Rothko Chapel! It&#39;s my favorite thing about his work. Even just pictures of it can give you a sense of what it&#39;s like. but due to how he painted on raw canvas, they actually had to shut it down while art preservationists try to figure out how to preserve his works while maintaining his intended installation.Also... my opinion is just art should make you feel something. Yeah, an artist can set up intentions and explain them, but sometimes artists make art and don&#39;t know why. They just know how to make art. And then they realize what it&#39;s about later.",0
"As someone who considers himself to be an artist, I often grapple with this question. The conclusion I&#39;ve come to is quite dryly this - as long as the commodity form exists, no art can have meaning that is universally &quot;the right one&quot; beyond the fact that it is a commodity; a result of my labour to be consumed. The intention is irrelevant. Just my two cents, thanks for reading lmao.",0
9:40 why an E tank in a damageless run?Clearly you know something I don&#39;t,0
"This has inspired me to start my own No Damage Run for Mega Man 11. (I&#39;m also banning the shop because semantics)So far, the stages are straight forward to map out. Actually doing it damageless is a pain, but very doable.The bosses though. Man. Those are rough. I&#39;ve done damage less runs for Block Man and Acid Man (in that order). I also cleared Blast Man&#39;s Stage (not Blast Man himself, he&#39;s insufferable). I&#39;m working on Impact Man. I&#39;ve cleared every room individually (except for Impact Man himself, also insufferable), but not in one run, which is annoying.I hope GameChamp will make a video on this at some point, but since we still have like... 6 more entries of Rock Man until then, guess I&#39;ll keep updating this. I&#39;ll do individual breakdowns and tips for each stage and boss if people are interested. Other than that I&#39;ll update when I&#39;ve made more progress.",0
if you tried megaman þe wily wars it would be boþ easier and harder at þe same time,0
"Every time I watch this video, Charles gets another year older.",0
I thought this was cool till I seen the pronouns why the hell do you need pronouns playing a game,1
Is it just me or is she going faster? Megaman 9 wont stand a chance,0
Oh cool she beat the first 8 bosses! Not even alfway through the video,0
game champ doesn&#39;t sound like a girl,1
if you can charge pharaoh shot against skull man can you charge the mega buster against him? apparently the answer is no I tested it on the mega man legacy collection.,0
"Drink some tea, would suffice",0
She/Her?,1
Splatoon three is out,0
"Great job, now do 5",0
"Shoutout to If you&#39;re seeing this then I forgot to change my Patreon name again before the latest video, how embarrassing would that be",0
She’s lost her mind,0
Splatoon 3 came out. Time for another no heroshot video,0
Challenge: go on mega maker and go through mega man 1 ex you won’t regret it btw it’s multiple levels,0
DO SPLATOON 3 NO HERO WEAPONS,0
Can I do Splatoon 3 without hero weapons,0
"Here&#39;s a challenge: Can you beat Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle with only the starter weapons?-Secondary weapons (Hammers, Grenade Ducks, etc.) are allowed-Moves like Dashing, Mario&#39;s Stomp Jump, and Peach&#39;s Royal Gaze are allowed as well-Upgrading the skill tree is allowed-Buying new weapons from the shop ISN&#39;T ALLOWED",0
Could u pls try splatoon 3 without fireing the hero shot (or weapons),0
i wonder if the cutscene shot by darkman 4 will count as damage in rockman 5,0
My favourite game of the saga... And the only one where I could beat all the boss levels without dying.Big props to you girl for beating it entirely without getting damage.,0
Okay but why do you play the Japanese versions of the games,0
"No wonder you said don&#39;t even ask about 4, you already did it.  Also, after 4 no damage runs and another beaten with it&#39;s joke weapon, I know the perfect challenge to do next: Can you beat Rockman Soccer without getting war flashbacks to the past no hit runs?",0
"Not sure this makes it useful for a no hit run, But I recently learned that you could actually store a charge shot  When using another weapon other than the megabuster. I didn&#39;t play the game in the Japanese version and I played it in the North American version, So in order to execute this Bug you had to 1st charge up your shot without releasing it, press the pause button swap to a different weapon, unpause ( And you can use the other weapon as much as you like before swapping again, as far as i can tell),  Pause again when you want to swamp back to the megabuster, Unpause and you will be greeted with Mega man instantly releasing a charge shot",0
If you don&#39;t use dust crusher on skull man then you can cheese wily machine 4 phase two as he has 28 health and dust crusher has 28 ammo.,0
Yooooooo dude more gamechamp,0
"What&#39;s up with the pronouns, is that an inside joke?",1
"I&#39;ve never been able to beat Toadmans stage without rewinds (water + snail be damned), so seeing someone complete it without taking any damage at all is blowing my mind",0
(Son)a big GeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeGeeeeeeeeeeeeeeere!,0
Why is everyone saying she? Edit. I’m new here,0
E-Tanks are always required for a no hit Megaman run if there is a Megaman game with E-tanks that doesn&#39;t require an E-tank for the no hit run then I will be shocked because the E-tanks are way too useful in the no hit runs for me to even think not using one is an option.,0
Can you do splatoon 3 without taking a shot,0
"Splatoon 3 is out, gonna do it weaponless",0
Uh isn&#39;t it mega ma-wait a minute mega man and rock man are the same ah,0
"I noticed you did Splatoon 1, 2, and Octo Expansion without the hero weapons. I was hoping you could make a video about Splatoon 3 now that it&#39;s out?",0
"well, with that Patreon news, can we get some F&#39;s out there for MacaroniCat?",0
Your work is insane ! I&#39;ve been binging your content for a week and now i&#39;m eager for more,0
"Hey there! This&#39;ll probably get buried under all the other comments and it isn&#39;t really on topic for the video, but i just wanted to let you know that your shotless runs of splatoon 1 and 2 have inspired me to theorycraft a minimum shot run of splatoon 3! (It&#39;s a google doc written in the form of a guide, partially dedicated to you)",0
9:38Why would you want an E Tank in a no damage run?,0
16:27 Luigi would be proud of Rockman during the Skull Man encounter.,0
I had about 500 heart attacks in a thousandth of a nanosecond,0
Dude what the heck are you ok?,0
Do the you know what in splatoon 3,0

"Mobility tool abuse, wacky enemy quirks, rng hell, and a very good boy. Only thing that is missing is pause shenanigans",0
Happy Birthday Charlie! Also do Rockman 6 or whatever IDC.,0
The dedication. The skill. The untold number of hours. Now do 5 👿,0
Happy birthday Charles also I just watched all your video&#39;s from the beginning and would also like to be featured in a video not a name shout out I just want you to read this comment with no context behind it. You have no obligation to do so and you are in the complete right if you don&#39;t even acknowledge this but even so it would be cool if you read this in the net video whatever that may be. Also my name is Yuokai.,0
"If she ever gets to Rockman 10 Damageless, I&#39;m fully expecting Wheel Cutter related shenanigans and I&#39;ll be there for it!",0
This video doesn&#39;t suck at all. Not sure how to improve.,0
Honestly I want to see him do a Mr.Perfect run on Mega Man and Bass 😂😂😂😂,0
oh god there&#39;s another spam bot,0
Splatoon 3 no shots plz,0
"Is the &quot;She/Her pronouns plz&quot; thing for real, or a mean joke?",1
"My personal theory for the &quot;deleting Taco&#39;s hurtbox&quot; glitch is that the boss has 2 segments, the vulnerable segment and the body segment, where it&#39;s damaging hurtbox is tied to, and while normally the game is programmed to negate the damage that that part ever takes, if it hits the weak spot, the game is programmed to deal damage, and the missile&#39;s area of effect is big enough to hit the body along with the weak spot, and because the devs intended for that segment to never be able to take damage if it does it dies, taking the damage hurtbox with it.",0
SUGGESTION O&#39;CLOCK! splatoon 3 without hero shot,0
For some reason I wondered why you didn&#39;t take the time to render this footage of an 8-bit video game in a resolution higher than 720p,0
"You did it again, Miss Gamechamp. Didn&#39;t have to wait that long for another MegaMan no damage run.",0
Let&#39;s GOOOO Gamechamp vid!,0
As I was eating dinner I was thinking &quot;maybe hitless Rockman 4 is out yet?&quot;. Pleasantly surprised. You absolute madlass.,0
the things that interest and amuse you are kinda sad...,0
where is &quot;how many shots does it take to beat splatoon 3&quot;? you did splatoon 1 shotless and the minimalist runs for splatoon 2 + the octo expansion so where is the splatoon 3 video[lol i said &quot;splatoon&quot; 4 times (5 if you count that last one)],0
Alright where&#39;s wily (says for the fight time),0
will you do a tier list for damageless megaman?,0
"This begs the question: Which is next? Rockman 5 hitless or Splatoon 3 shotless?Either way, I&#39;m hyped",0
now do 5.,0
"The fact the spambot replies to every comment in order makes it mighty easy to mass report, that&#39;s good service!",0
you should try to complete splatoon 3with no shooting,0
There&#39;s so much strategy on a game that plays with only 4 buttons and dpad,0
oh god there&#39;s a spam bot. Gamechamp!! Call the exterminator!!,0
"Man, this guy is really good.",0
9:21 this could be the perfect line for some villian,0
This is one of the most impressive and awesome video game achievements I&#39;ve ever seen. Nothing beats the amazement on my face seeing gamechamp somehow manage to beat Rockman 4 without taking a single hit. It must have taken years to come up with these clever strategies. Now do Rockman 5,0
Why do we need the Dive Man E Tank?,0
"Can you beat the Half-Life 1 Pacifist run?Rules:-Not allowed to harm anything-Enemy is allowed to harm itself (i.e. Houndeye destroys an Explosive crate with its attack)-Mandatory boss fights (Gonarch, Blast Pit Tentacles, etc.) are allowed to be attacked-If an enemy is killed by you in some way, you are allowed to load a previous saveOptional routes:-If playing on the Black Mesa remake, try also going for the Rarest Specimen or Pizza Precipitation achievement",0
And this was the worst of the 11 games.,0
I have a questionOn a scale of 1 to 10 how much easier was this that rockman 3,0
"Dear Ms. 3000: You claim to not be good at videogames, yet your name is &quot;Gamechamp&quot;, which implies being good at video games. Why do you say this? Are you secretly good at video games, ms. 3000?",0

SHES DONE IT AGAIN,0
9:37 doesn&#39;t E tanks heal? This is a no damage run right?,0
"Maybe it&#39;s because I owned this one, but I feel like the robot patterns are MUCH easier to master than Megaman 3. Plus of course, it doesn&#39;t have those damn middle levels.",0
wow this game looks way better designed than mm3,0

"I don’t know if you can, but I can &gt;:]",0
WOW ALLREADY ITS HEREEEEEEE,0
So splatoon 3 is out... try to do that challenge where you see how much times you shoot,0
9:21 abortion,0
"as someone whos playd this game 10000000 times (not exaggeration probably) its very funny to see any of the minibosses described as dangerous. ive fought them all so much that i do them damageless anyway, the rhythm is in my soul",0
Splatoon 3 Shotless/Minimum Shots when?,0
Still bad at videogames,0
You got hit multiple times in this video so you did lose the challenge,0

I like that this is probably the first mr perfect run that you can do in order,0
well now you have to do rockman 5!,0
Can you complete splatoon 3 hero mode without shooting all weapons but with specials,0
Can you? Yes. With a TAS,0
You sure don&#39;t sound like a she,1
I wonder if the 5th game will take 5 yearsI also think we can all agree that toad man is the best boss in all of video game history,0
If you use the charge shot only its easier to time drill man.,0
Great video also when will you do a splatoon 3 without main weapons video,0
Was a while ago I last watched your videos and this happened to be in my recommendeds! So glad to see you’re still around beating video games! I’ll definitely make sure to watch some of your newer uploads!,0
"I dunno if you still take suggestions in comments, but here goes:Can you beat Mega Man Legends without collecting treasure?",0
This is great!! I have to go watch the others now that I know about them!,0
"weird how I first thought you weren&#39;t gonna do mega man 3, then 4. but at this rate your probably gonna do them all by the time mega man 12 comes out lol",0
Perfect-san 4 (100),0
Next up rockman 5 and no need for special weapon all you need charge buster shot only because is busted,0
Now Mega Man X without getting hit. &gt;=),0
Good luck beating splatoon with bombs only (definitely not possible),0
May I suggest rockman 6 without taking damage/j,0
&quot;We&#39;ll acquire Item Number B&quot; threw me. I&#39;ve been awake for 24 hours. I need to sleep.,0

This one seemed to be a little easier than Rockman 4,0
Why collect E-tank?,0
You’ve done it yet once again,0
Wanna hear my guess for the next run? Splatoon 3 Minimum Shot Run…in it’s entirety.,0

I never knew you were trans! Not that it&#39;s relevant in any way to my enjoyment of your content. Just interesting to know about you!,0
what does a girl have to do to see No More Heroes beaten on bitter without taking a hit,0
why do you put yourself through this torture?,0
You should do splatoon 3 with minimum shots,0
"i do not know who this is, but when reading the names at the end, YOU MISSED CHARLES SURETTwhoever that is42:55",0
Do you think the Megaman 8 hitless challenge will be harder than the ball only challenge?,0
"Its crazy how this was probably harder and has a longer video and took less time than 3, gamechamp is becoming more powerful and we have to make sure she doesnt reach mm8",0
"Wtf, Skull Barrier has a USE on the final boss?You&#39;re an awesome player! Trans rights ^^",0
maybe for the trash robot they just put a random robot hit box and when you shot that missile it legally kills the bot and thus the hit box is gone?,0
"I’m curious, why are you doing the jp version instead of the English?",0
This just proves that rockman 3 is a bit more difficult than its sequel,0
is she gonna go back to 3d platformers? i love gamechamp but all the megamans look the same to someone who didnt play them &lt;.&lt;,0

"who&#39;s rockman, and why the hell did they rip off mega man?",0
dude just said icba to read all this shi at the end lol,0
It’s time.,0
Idea splatoon 3  reasonable diet challange,0
"the end credits have gotten so long now, you can never truly tell when the actual challenge is finished",0
Alright. Just to continue the joke. Do Rockman 5.,0
"Happy birthday a couple days late, Charles. Also I wanna know if you subscribe to Gamechamp&#39;s patreon if you can get her to say something really heinous and taboo, like &quot;I like pineapple on pizza sometimes&quot; or something similarly forbidden.",0
I just realized he took damage multiple times,0
"Oh, you went full she/her for your pronouns now. :Oc Good for you, hon. ❤️",0
This was done really quick I remember watching the streams where you was practicing the final boss,0
"Nice, now rockman 5",0
"At this point, the boss music doesn’t play for the Robot Masters, it plays for her now.",0
Something about this and the No-damage run of MM3 feels off when compared to the first two.,0
So when&#39;s Minus Infinity?,0
"Mega Man 4 is my favorite game in the NES hexalogy. The charge buster is pretty fun (even if it edges a little close to being the go-to weapon over Robot Master weapons at times), Cossack and Kalinka are great characters who don&#39;t show up often enough, the visuals are very nice, the music is great, it has some of my favorite Robot Masters, and it&#39;s the first time we see Wily use an innocent person for his own gain (besides Light himself), which shows how far Wily will go to further his own plans. I&#39;m glad to see you finally put it back on the shelf!(Is it notable that there are skull-based enemies before Wily&#39;s reveal, including a whole Robot Master themed around them, implying that Wily&#39;s skull aesthetic is so strong to him that he can&#39;t even abandon it while trying to go unnoticed? Could be! I think it&#39;s a fun flaw to apply to Wily)",0
Love how she talks like anyone else is gonna do this.,0
What happened to no hitting Rockman 3 being enough?,0
HOLY CRAP SHE DID IT!Now do 5,0
I saw this and felt badThe poor lass is onto 5 now I bet,0
i have no tips he is unbeatable,0
The skill. The mastery over the game. Now do Rockman 5.,0
Do you think it would be possible to do a no-damage run on Rockman 4 minus infinity?,0
isnt rockman just mega man but japanese,0
ROCKMAN 5,0
Splatoon 3 bomb run only when?,0
rock 5,0
"I meeeeean, Rockman 5 would be cool, but now I wanna see a splatoon 3 shotless run",0
I can’t wait for Gamechamp to eventually suffer fighting Wily Machine 7 when she eventually plays MM7.,0
Based patreon supporters,0
Rockman 5 Now hhihih worth a year wait. &lt;3,0
"I don’t know why she tortures herself like this, either way it sure is rad!",0
Do kingdom hearts 3 level 1 please,0
Dr. Wily comes back from the dead!ok... WHAT?,0
Get good at video games,0
"the sequel to an amazing video which is also a sequel to another sequel that no one asked for, but one we needed",0

QUEEN IVE BEEN WAITING FOR A NEW VID,0
Now do rockman 5,0
She/Her?,1
HOW DID I NOT SEE I NEW MISS MYTH VIDEO SOONER?! Ugh and a Rockman challenge  today is great.,0
Sometimes I forget that this a mega man no damage run and I just watch you doing random stuff,0
Great work!,0
We all know whats next lassie...Rockman 5.,0
"Can you beat mario sunshine without walking forward? The hover nozzle and yoshi could make this possible, and the hovering would look like it&#39;s forward in the reverse footage. Which is what I really want to see.",0
Amazing as always,0
Well splatoon 3 came out .... have fun with that,0
Happy birthday to Charles!!!,0
Gamechamp repeatedly referring to letters as numbers is the kind of low level trolling that I&#39;m subscribed for. Never change.,0
Classic megaman is known for its cheap hits. It&#39;s nice to see someone no damage it,0
Okay but I am so gonna overthink that use of splatoon music at the end 👀,0
"Toad man is even easier if you just shoot him with a single bullet every time he holds up his hands. Then he won’t even jump and he’ll be locked in place, constantly trying to hold up his hands like he’s at a rave.",0
you do realize that your fans will just give you more money since we want to see the credits be longer than the video right?,0
"Oh, of course the one boss that &quot;does nothing&quot; is the skeleton one.",0
“We used to ride these babies for miles.”,0
"Happy Birthday, Charles!",0
HAPPY BIRTHDAY CHARELS,0
This was awesome. I enjoyed hearing her walkthrough of the no-hit run as she mercilessly disarmed Dr. Cossack.,0
No fuckin way yo,0
"36:33Oh wooooow, I wish I had known that when I was getting the &quot;Beat Wily Machine 4 damageless&quot; cheevo on RetroAchievements.Been watching these videos for a while now. Very impressive achievements, all and all, well done. :)",0
I was not at all expecting you to continue but now i want to see how many games you can get through,0
"Oh boy, can&#39;t wait for the Splatoon 3 minimum shot challenge",0
I love this series and can’t wait for future episodes and fun things I might have not known about the games.,0
"44:17rip that dream, may you rest in peace",0
Somehow Dr. Wiley returns.,0
The amount of dedication In all your runs have them is crazy. Great vid as always!,0
THE MADLASS DID IT!,0
"I blame iron side computers for their comment last time. But seriously, dont stop doing these challenges, you are a gamin G O D, and I beat cuphead for cryin out loud!",0
He didn&#39;t take you three years like last time,0
Item number W. Ah the best number W,0
your video has an attractive thumbnail,0
The best instance of the e tank gag thus far,0
im so confused in your bio it says nonbinary and she her can someone please help me with my confusion,0
Why have eddy give the e tank if you&#39;re not planning on getting hit?,0
mega man 4 already? that&#39;s what i call a speedrun....      NOW WHERE&#39;S MEGA MAN 5?,0
Wait…flash stopper be-Oh no! The great purge of the youtuber language has started for gamechamp3000 and I will soon have to unsubscribe. I am as serious as the plague.,0
"Also, BEAUTIFUL THUMBNAIL!!!",0
Oh snap. Prepare the rock busters.,0
Man I thought you died after your mega man 3 video but hey this looks easier than last time,0
NOOOOOO! SHES MAKING IT SHORTER!,0
I always wondered why Gamechamp always insisted on playing the Japanese versions. Is it really just a preference thing?,0
LET;S FUCKING GOOOOOO O,0
"Know what, cause I like ya, im gonna get all the requests out and about for ya so you dont gotta worry about them. Ahem: Can you do Rockman 5, 6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,X,X2,X3,X4,X5,X6,X7,X8,X9,X10, Battle Network 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 AND....Latte simulator 2043?",0
i loved ur splatoon series without using the weapons ur supposed to! their really cool and interesting. whenever u get splatoon 3 do you know if u could try that challenge? (its kinda like octo expansion but easier),0
Oh duck 😳 I need see All the playlist of Megaman Damageless again,0
"incredible video, i learned a lot while watching and i&#39;ll definitely use some of these tricks for fun even if i&#39;m not planning to no hit this game any time soon! I love videos that dive into games like this and have a lot of specific game knowledge that one can apply in their own runs (:",0
Damn this happened a whole lot faster than I thought it would,0
"Compared to the run of 3, is say that this one was overall underwhelming. I don&#39;t think you could possibly beat the legendary run that 3 had. Not that this video was bad, its well made and still gamechamp quality.",0
I can&#39;t wait for some point in the future where we get a Splatoon 3 no shots video.,0
I dunno why people keep saying the Queen is dead she just posted 👑,0
"i have been following this series, so instant like for cuz respect",0
item number b,0
"YOU MADMAN, good job",0
4 done. 7 more to go,0
"this video autoplayed and i had a heartattack, when i watched the first damageless rockman video i was 4 years old. now im 35 with a familly living the life of my dreams. God Bless.",0
"Either Gamechamp powered through this entire game painfully, or this game is very much easier than Mega Man 3 or she just gotten very very good",0
Has anyone kept up with the slowest game of chess? I have had a hard time keeping up with it.,0
gg! now beat rockman 5,0
22:15 mans really said tshasm 💀,0
I am comparatively unimpressed.,0
"Keep it up man, yer good at this",0
oh shit that was fast! nice going ms. champ :-),0
WOOO ITS OUT,0
you should do splatoon 3 no shots,0
So is rock man another name for Megaman or what?,0
"1:39 Item Number B, thats my favorite color!",0
Can you do splatoon 3 next?,0
Men,0
Poor Charles. :c,0
Can you beat Rockman # without getting hit-gamerchamp2000 2022,0
Nobody wishing Charles a happy birthday?,0
Alright but now you have to do every game in a row and restart to the first game on any hit,0
"man, Skull Man is pretty sexy. Super Hot, even.",0
Please start work on 5 soon,0
if you can do THIS and still be bad at videogames then i have no idea what you have to do to be good at videogames...,0
NO WAY MY GUY IS HAVING NIGHTMARES AGAIN,0
There&#39;s gotta be a meme of Mega Man throwing empty cans at a braindead Skull Man,0
Great video 👍,0
"44:01Gotta say that is a very good snooping as usual, nicely done miss champ",0
That was a quick 3 years,0
"Very cool, but can you beat Mighty Number 9 WITHOUT TAKING DMG",0
WAIT ARE YOU ACTUALLY GOING TO TRY NO HIT ALL ROCKMAN GAMES???IF YOU&#39;RE DOING IT THEN THAT WOULD BE THE MOST POGCHAMP MOMENT EVER,0
"What happened to “all the bugs Yugi has killed”. Also, I’m glad I’m listening  to more of these Patreon names now.",0

"dude, you said never again... are you a masochist?",0
Happy birthday Charles!!!,0
Can someone please go back and recite the chess game so far this is interesting me,0
Oh god,0
"This one was painful to start but great to finish. I wanted to weep &quot;Please don&#39;t do this to yourself, miss&quot;... and then it took her less than 98 tries. She&#39;s a boss.",0
Am impressed that this took waaaaaaaaaaaaaay less than megaman 3,0
Question why do you choose the Japanese version?,0
Do the Rockman 4 Minus Infinity damageless now.,0
15:46 “with dust man finally living up to his namesake”,0
Jesus that fast?,0
i see u foreshadowing splatoon 3 no shot run. u got splatoon 3 music at the end,0
"i watched this while beating splatoon 3s story mode, i was constantly thinking about shot shaves and how you would do an episode on it, cant wait!",0
Your insane (in a good way)❤🎉😊,0
Wait in this video it&#39;s called rock man but where I live its says mega man?,0
“Wow it didn’t take her long to do this one!”Looks at date of the the 3rd video“Oh it was a year ago”My brain is weird when it comes to time,0
Thumbnail: in 4k with hyper cool colorsThe Actual Video: in 720p,0
"&gt;ITEM NUMBER BIT&#39;S OKAY, SOMETIMES I FORGET HOW TO COUNT TOO :^)",0
"Ggs, gamechampNow do 5",0
THE TOADMAN &quot;STRAT&quot; OH MY GOD,0
I tought it was Megaman,0
When&#39;s Rockboard damageless?,0
"Out of curiosity, does this version of the Mega Man Collection have any Mr Perfect achievements tied to it? If I remember right I think Mega Man 8(?) on Xbox 360 actually has a dedicated Mr Perfect achievement.",0
Just a reminder for splatoon 3 no hero weapons video :),0
"Ahh. Time to sit down, turn on one of my favorite YouTubers, and observe their pain and suffering for my own viewing experience.",0
"Wow, Toad Man being utterly worthless is uh o_O.A bit of a shock to me. I guess they wanted people to have an easy starter boss but like ???Is this legit the easiest Megaman (All of them) boss or ???I can&#39;t. Think of any that would be anywhere near this effortless. I mean I haven&#39;t played basic Megaman (IE this series being video&#39;d) but uh...",0
Beat splatoon 3 only bombs,0
Rip queen she would have loved this video,0
So if you&#39;re doing a no damage run why do you need an e tank?,0
Hahahahahahaha!,0
why did you do this to yourself again gamechamp,0
"No damage, buster only: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4Lscasoi2utdgs7vH7LUlJXWuRhfn7E3",0
Funny how the Robot Master based on a skeleton doesn&#39;t have a (functioning) brain. It almost feels intentional.,0
And here we go again for the 4th time,0
"At this rate, gamechamp’s beat all Rockman games with no damage in less than a 3 months",0
"Great!!! Now do Rockman 5. Jk, nice vid as always!",0
I have the feeling that poor GameChamp is somehow going to do literally every Megaman game without getting hit and if she does then good lord i pray for her sanity,0
waiting for a splatoon 3 no-gun run.,0
Happy Birthday Charles :),0
She/her pronouns? I had no idea you were based,0
"Random thing, i really have liked your splatoon videos and was wondering if you are going to do a gunless splatoon 3",0
"You make these look so easy, I decided to play them myself.. how hard could it be?Couldn&#39;t even get past the first level 😂These games are way harder than they look!",0
"the wily capsule reminded me of the wily capsule from Rockman 7. to my memory, it’s almost impossible to dodge his attacks. doing this sets you up for pure suffering along the road",0
"I think this wily may just be Willy&#39;s brother wahwee. Remember, Wily is actually from an alien race.",0
Well that was fast. Congratulations girl,0
I just realized the name at 42:38 is supposed to be the Welsh town. You know the one.,0
&#39;Mega man 5 theme starts&#39;I&#39;m sorry ok,0
31:06 c’mon now dawg,0
rockman 5 next,0
SHE’S BACK!,0
Now do it with Rockman 4 Minus Infinity.,0
I&#39;ve been thinking if actually recording a mega man X hitless video is a good idea,0
"&quot;They don&#39;t address this in game, but if you check the wiki: Kalinka asked her Dad pretty please for the Necronomicon.&quot;That is a sentence I heard while I was alive",0
"this one came out suspiciously fast compared to the other one, I hope your not being good at a video game.",0
"You did it. You crazy son of a gun, you did it",0
God help this girl,0
"I CALLED IT, I CALLED IT!",0
SHES BACK BABY,0
That&#39;s it you&#39;re going to Guam,0
why do you do this to yourself?,0
"I&#39;m not sure why you directed viewers to farm Eddie/Fliptop for an E-tank.  Obviously, no health recovery was needed if you pull off the damage-less run.  I thought perhaps there was some sort of AI alteration that occurred from having one in your inventory, but there was never a mention of it after pick-up.",0
Does anyone know that this person’s pronouns are? I heard that they’re she/they but I could be thinking about someone else. I used to watch this channel a ton but I haven’t lately.,0
THE RETURN OF THE KING!!!,0
"splatoon 3 without shooting, right now...",0
"If we never want to see Gamechamp again, they should do a ‘Can You Beat All Mega Man Maker NRS Levels without Damage’ run.",0
Bro i just got done watching your other 3💀💀💀,0
I will miss the 6 minute outros they are honestly my favourite part,0
SHE&#39;S BACK!!!,0
no fucking way he acutally fuckjing did it wtf,0
"I&#39;m looking forward for the splatoon 3 minimum shots video, sad the first boss stops bombs only",0
"&quot;hi, i&#39;m gamechamp and i make my living off of reading funny names and playing video games incorrectly &quot;so basically all of us after watching a gamechamp video?",0
:0000000,0
So recoded next month?,0
DUDE,0
"45:02 Huh, it looks like &quot;I&#39;m going to unban Julius Xeno&quot; finally managed to unban Julius Xeno. Good for them.",0
"I like how you can tell how much more polished this game is in general compared to 3, so much less hearing about hits being basically random chance, and more skill and proper weapon usage.",0
completely pointless but here&#39;s a glitch for Rockman 4. If you finish off the cockroaches while flash stopper is in play the game will softlock with the spikes being the only way out,0
Mega Man 4-6 are much better designed than 1-3 so its obvious that they can be beaten without taking damage without any major mental gymnastic or outlandish effort.,0
"No way!You actually did it, Such hard work!................Now do Rockman 5",0
Hey game champ! Splatoon 3 is out and I&#39;m wondering if u can beat the whole campain with either a bomb or little buddy please,0
"As someone who did MM4 run recently, with as little special weapon uses as possiblei can say one thing:I HATE SQUARE MACHINE I HATE SQUARE MACHINE I HATE SQUARE MACHINE I HATE SQUARE MACHINE I HATE SQUARE MACHINE",0
Wait you finished this run in less than a year? IMPOSSIBLE!,0
6:12 Sprite Man,0
ain&#39;t no fucking way,0
"&quot;can you beat the entire Rockman series without getting hit&quot; when? I&#39;m waiting. (with the same rules, as in a complete reset of the whole series if you take damage) Good luck",0
"Oh just great, I go on vacation 2 days per year and that&#39;s the day the MM4 no hit run gets uploaded",0
"Remember when she said “DO NOT ASK ME ABOUT THE FOURTH GAME”?Welp, the fourth game has been blessed upon us",0
Ah yes my favorite number W,0
Can&#39;t wait for the future when Gamechamp reveals she actually knows how to pronounce Llanfair­pwllgwyngyll­gogery­chwyrn­drobwll­llan­tysilio­gogo­goch,0
Wow Gamechamp is very smart and skilled and funny,0
"at about 3:33 the visuals of the video froze but it wasn&#39;t yet buffering (common lag thing for me, network card was fried and there&#39;s an unreliable wifi adapter) so i thought the pause trick was back",0
LETS GOOOOOO,0
Please make a run: can you beat splatoon 3 without firing the hero gear,0
41:51 The spirit of the Binding of Isaac narrator took over champ for this one,0
SHE DID IT. Gamechamp is on her way to being the Master of Mega™,0
silly woman gaming moment,0
do jak 3 without eco powers or guns whatever you choose,0
I swear just yesterday she was telling us to not ask for rockman 4. Time flies.,0
Dedicated I respect it,0
You were the Chosen one you promised that you wont torture youself with No Hit megaman4,0
amazing work as always!,0
YEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAHHHHHH-,0
Well that was fast and unexpected and amazing and awesome,0
NOW YOU MUST beat splatoon 3 story mode with bombs only or what ever count as bombs but still DO YOU MAD MAN!,0
THE QUEEN IS BACK,0
"I seriously want her patience, this video was wild",0
This series has some crazy lore ngl,0
Somehow you always upload when I’m away from home in extended amounts of time. You’re basically my comfort channel.,0
Rockman 2 no damage: NEVER AGAINRockman 3 no damage: ABSOLUTELY NEVER AGAINRockman 4: I did it again,0
Wait so you think there will be less names to read? Lady you are either foolish or good at making money.,0
I love how she took every opportunity to be as silly as humanly possible.,0
"Wow, this came out far sooner than I expected. Impressive Gamechamp.",0
"Happy birthday, Charles.",0
"If you did or didn&#39;t know this &quot;tip&quot; already, Rockmans 5 and 6 are pretty much just more of 4, but with changes to Rush and the items.",0
"Let&#39;s suffer toggether, GameChamp. I always attempt to do these as I see you upload them.I shamelessly use your suffering to decrease my own. I&#39;m not sorry, I&#39;m thankful.",0
"yesssssss new gamechamp, today is a good day",0
at this point she may as well do one of these for a bullet hell like touhou or dodonpachi or something.her tenacity is frightening...,0
Man I’m just drunk and seeing this uploaded just made my night,0
WHERE IS SPLATOON 3 WITHOUT FIRING THE HERO SHOT???,0
Splatoon 3 min shot run pls,0
"38:54 If you had gotten hit there, I&#39;d have died.",0
No way,0
"&quot;It&#39;d be just like playing the game with its original controls&quot;If anything, it&#39;s worse, because Input delay.",0
This took no time to come out compared to 3. Maybe Gamechamp is good at video games after all…,0
"Yooo that was actually fast compared to the last one, thought it&#39;d be another multi year silence to beat this beast, well done!",0
Rockman No Damage - Episode 4: A New Hope,0
Wow four way steak of megaman games,0
So is Splat 3 story hero weaponless on the horizon?,0

6:21 yep,0
It would be about the &quot;puzzle platform aesthetic&quot; if the puzzle wasnt immediately solved. Everybody knows what they need to do its just hard to vidualize or internalize the timing. A lot of times in mario maker levels its a near frame perfect jump or a visual cue using a coin tail to aid in the process of the high skill required to complete the level. (Most kaizo levels have stuff like that) i just cant easily visuallize any cues in this. If its really about the puzzle and not just a trollish tree jump into a 1 block space then it feels like there should be some kind of visual cue,0
I am 10 and I like your videos,0

It appears that there is an animation of mario getting up after he ground pounds and then jo interrupted that animation while turning the other direction and crouching while also clipping into the !block at frame perfect accuracy causing that too happen,0

"Ya know something man what really pisses me off about the world we live in today especially in the West I mean is the way people slam others like this just because he has a different view on homosexuality. You would think that gay people would be happy enough with same sex marriages, gay rights, and freedom of speech but shit man as soon as someone says that they don&#39;t agree with it they are automatically slammed as a homophobe lol??? What about straight people? Don&#39;t they get to use their freedom of speech too? If a person turns around and says that their country has no use for homosexuality then you need to suck it up or stop listening if it butt hurts your well being because it&#39;s his right to say whatever he wants also. As long as people ain&#39;t using gay slurs or passing nasty derogatory remarks or calling people names because they are gay then people should just put up or shut up. He ain&#39;t causing undue pain and suffering to anyone just by saying that his country had no interest in such things he&#39;s just voicing his opinion and he&#39;s not bashing anyone and he&#39;s not slurring anyone. People should learn that it&#39;s not just their world and people can say whatever the F they want just as long as they ain&#39;t proper taking the piss or taking any liberties while doing so.",1

Couldn&#39;t agree more. In Canada a few years ago a transexual woman who still had a penis went to several salons asking for bikini waxes but was denied as the married women didn&#39;t want to fiddle with another man&#39;s penis. The salons were initially forced to close over bigotry as the transexual had sued them. Utterly disgraceful,1

They are Christians and hold those principles important, not perversions creeping around to pollute the minds of the young.

It really gives you perspective to realize that the kinds of social issues that we tie ourselves in knots over day by day are just not on the radar of other countries who spend their energies focused on problems like widespread poverty, lack of education, fighting disease, and so forth. There is a prevailing feeling among many in the West that many issues like LGBT rights and feminism are the great battles upon which the fate of all human civilization rests. In contrast, listening to this Kenyan president provides a window through which we can realize that regardless of your views on various modern social debates, it is mark of how blessed and well-off we are in the West that these are the kinds of things that we can afford to focus on.",1

Hence the washing of hands and hygienic courtesies of Muslim and Jewish traditions.

This really is a non issue in Kenya otherwise other Afrikans wouldn&#39;t come to Kenya to find safety because they&#39;re being persecuted in their own countries because of their sexual/gender beliefs, the law is there but it&#39;s not enforced, people are free to themselves in Kenya and their rights are protected by the constitution.",1

Ur intro says Mairo lol,0
Most of the countries in the world have bigger problems than lgbt rights. When all those important issues are solved then those minor such as lgbt rights come up. But whole west is ignorant towards others problems and push their own as &quot;global&quot; which we saw in the video. Also racism. I believe everyone can have wrong beliefs and be racist but only in previous colonial powers is that a big issue. And of course its being pushed as global problem. I am sure Kenyans and 70% of the planet would like to have lgbt rights as their major political topic.,1

What about straight people? Don&#39;t they get to use their freedom of speech too? If a person turns around and says that their country has no use for homosexuality then you need to suck it up or stop listening if it butt hurts your well being because it&#39;s his right to say whatever he wants also. As long as people ain&#39;t using gay slurs or passing nasty derogatory remarks or calling people names because they are gay then people should just put up or shut up. He ain&#39;t causing undue pain and suffering to anyone just by saying that his country had no interest in such things he&#39;s just voicing his opinion and he&#39;s not bashing anyone and he&#39;s not slurring anyone. People should learn that it&#39;s not just their world and people can say whatever the F they want just as long as they ain&#39;t proper taking the piss or taking any liberties while doing so.",1

"Regardless of where you come from, the LGBTQ + do not represent the mass of the population. At one point many were sympathizing with the volume of physical abuse these groups were having, and indeed these things were address and they were given eventually equal rights to live in society and to practice their lifestyle in certain countries, but they were not satisfied, they wanted to force their ways into every avenues of life. The were forcing themselves into private businesses and purposely targeting specific business with the hopes that those businesses would so call discriminate, and they were successful to a certain degree with some. They were targeting churches especially Christian churches in the hopes of forcing believers to accept their lifestyle in the churches and with the even greater hope of getting bibles removed and rewritten to suite their agenda. They are trying to force societies to accept their lifestyle as normal. That is why they were pushing the educational systems to give lessons to children about the lifestyle as being normal, shoving the idea in the minds of children, confusing the children with lies with no real science to back it up. They are successful with countries where they have either many members infiltrated in high positions or have sympathizers doing the work for them. If put the vote, real votes like it was done in the time of the cowboys and Indians, you would see how many reject this nonsense. I hope Kenya will continue to push and reject and not allow their little parades to be given rights that many of us would not even be able to do even with are normal ideas.",1

Couldn&#39;t agree more.

"While He represents the will of his people, i don&#39;t think That is whats Happening in the first World. Everyone I talk to are so done with lgbtq Agenda pushed down our throats but somehow its what everyone is legit scared to voice. How can That be? The politicians love These topics bc noone loses when we push lgbtq stuff but if actual change is asked for the poor and under priviledged the politicians just try to beat around the Bush bc the rich pay them to not make any change That could hurt them... It&#39;s a mad world",1
Big up Kenya and this Man,0
Thankfully there are still a few sane leaders left in this world.,0
Yet people wonder why the white man doesn&#39;t take Africa seriously,0
I’ve seen two African leaders speak on this issue in the last month. A huge breath of fresh air when it comes to answering questions with honest answers.<br><br>Still put yourself in the position of a gay man in Kenya. What a horrendous situation to find yourself in. I’ve heard of stories of gay people been stoned to death and then set on fire in the street.,0
Every country has his own main religion and culture. Stop forcing your woke shit on those countries. Funny how they want homosexuals to be acceptes while they dont even accept his countries culture,1

"In Africa, we see people as people. In South Africa, we&#39;ve enshired such things into words - so that it &#39;feels&#39; enshired. As a people, we accept people as people, brothers and sisters.

What does she not understand about that? He’s basing his choices off what all his people request, rather than tyrannically making laws influenced by his own emotion. The US is the US, Kenya is Kenya.

"Who the hell is this anchor to tell the Kenyan Pres what is good for his country and his people.  They care about economic growth, feeding their families, and making it through the day. They have real problems to deal with, not the feelings of the lgbt and whether they can parade their degeneracy in the streets.  They are Christians and hold those principles important, not perversions creeping around to pollute the minds of the young. I do admit jail time is harsh - def not the death penalty is ok, but keeping a stance to ensure that as long as 2 people are consenting adults to keep it behind closed doors is not too much to ask.  Russia&#39;s stance is just that - Dont bring it to the streets!",1

"This interviewer doesn&#39;t realize that not everyone has the luxury of addressing issues like LGBT rights. If your country or society consider their biggest problem is the lack of LGBT rights, you are privileged beyond your understanding.

It really gives you perspective to realize that the kinds of social issues that we tie ourselves in knots over day by day are just not on the radar of other countries who spend their energies focused on problems like widespread poverty, lack of education, fighting disease, and so forth. There is a prevailing feeling among many in the West that many issues like LGBT rights and feminism are the great battles upon which the fate of all human civilization rests. In contrast, listening to this Kenyan president provides a window through which we can realize that regardless of your views on various modern social debates, it is mark of how blessed and well-off we are in the West that these are the kinds of things that we can afford to focus on.",1
Why doesn&#39;t the American Media ever go to other countries and interview the leaders there about how America treats black people?? Why don&#39;t they ever ask them what do they feel about the American government allowing the daily murder of black people in the streets?? Since they&#39;re so concerned about human rights. Why don&#39;t they ever go to these foreign countries and ask the leaders why America comes in and steals their natural resources and leaves many nations poor??,0
The only rights that matter are civil right and human rights. Everything else is extra bullshit,0

"She basically pushed him into a corner of you&#39;re a homophob and his like where we come from that isn&#39;t up for discussion. <br>Historically sexual intercourse between men involved the act of placing your penis in the Anus. Which definatly without the medicines and understanding of hygiene of today, would&#39;ve caused infections and illnesses. Religious and ancient laws are made as guidelines for everyday life. Hence the washing of hands and hygienic courtesies of Muslim and Jewish traditions. Holy water to wash hands and hallal/kosha meat to drain the blood to prevent the meat from rotting so quickly in the heat. <br>Understanding is the first step to resolution not blaming and instigating conflict on opinions and beliefs.",1

This really is a non issue in Kenya otherwise other Afrikans wouldn&#39;t come to Kenya to find safety because they&#39;re being persecuted in their own countries because of their sexual/gender beliefs, the law is there but it&#39;s not enforced, people are free to themselves in Kenya and their rights are protected by the constitution.",1

He Fell straight ..That&#39;s the only thing Straight about him,1
i completely understand freedom of speech but judging from the comments its very clear we forget about freedom in general. freedom to marry and love who you want. its not a hard concept to grasp. there&#39;s absolutely no reason why people should be praising a man for saying he doesnt care about equality lmao... thats not something you praise get your morals straightened out... but i also get what hes saying personally i disagree a little since some people are ofc afraid to speak out about what they want (so many examples of this i shouldnt have to give examples).,0

Most of the countries in the world have bigger problems than lgbt rights. When all those important issues are solved then those minor such as lgbt rights come up. But whole west is ignorant towards others problems and push their own as &quot;global&quot; which we saw in the video. Also racism. I believe everyone can have wrong beliefs and be racist but only in previous colonial powers is that a big issue. And of course its being pushed as global problem. I am sure Kenyans and 70% of the planet would like to have lgbt rights as their major political topic.,1
Isis &quot;You may be gay but you&#39;ll fall straight.&quot;,1

"Homosexuality is a western invention.They , the west, is trying to prove that people are born gay, that its a matter of genetics. In islam there is no such thing as sexual categorisation. Any man could desire another man, it could happen to me to you , even to the prophets. Once the sahabas(companions of the prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him) asked the prophet if they could have sex with men war prisoner and the prophet forbid it. Were the sahaba gay? No, they were just far from their wives and they thought that they could commit sodomy with other man in halal way yet the prophet stopped them. If Allah didnt created women, probably Homosexuality could be halal. But Allah in his wisdom made Eve as wife of adam so that adam could have halal sex . If Allah would have not created women, then all men would have sex with each other. The strong would prey upon the weak . The world would be a big prison and we all know what happen when we incarcerate men together. Do they suddenly turn gay? People should ask themselves these question. But only the one who reason would understand.And one of His signs is that He created for you spouses from among yourselves so that you may find comfort in them. And He has placed between you compassion and mercy. Surely in this are signs for people who reflect. Surah rum aya 21",1

"Very well put Mr. President! Couldn&#39;t agree with you more, and am speaking as a supporter of LGBTQ community. As westerners, we seem to have &quot;solved&quot; some problems and now can focus on the issues like sexual orientation but Kenyans doesn&#39;t need to necessarily have this priority just coz the western suddenly started to embrace it. In their own time they will. They have more dire problems such as hunger, water shortage, poverty,  etc. So that is their call when they make a ruling on the subject, not ours to make or judge upon. Us Americans can&#39;t even make strong laws for gun control which is responsible for thousands of lives in a year at least. Who are we to tell anyone else how to live and what laws to follow?",0

CNN are you gay because you used the Balls Gay Reference on PS4 Messages.

"If your gonna give this leader a trouble, what about that one leader in a specific north of korea?",0
"Regardless of where you come from, the LGBTQ + do not represent the mass of the population. At one point many were sympathizing with the volume of physical abuse these groups were having, and indeed these things were address and they were given eventually equal rights to live in society and to practice their lifestyle in certain countries, but they were not satisfied, they wanted to force their ways into every avenues of life. The were forcing themselves into private businesses and purposely targeting specific business with the hopes that those businesses would so call discriminate, and they were successful to a certain degree with some. They were targeting churches especially Christian churches in the hopes of forcing believers to accept their lifestyle in the churches and with the even greater hope of getting bibles removed and rewritten to suite their agenda. They are trying to force societies to accept their lifestyle as normal. That is why they were pushing the educational systems to give lessons to children about the lifestyle as being normal, shoving the idea in the minds of children, confusing the children with lies with no real science to back it up. They are successful with countries where they have either many members infiltrated in high positions or have sympathizers doing the work for them. If put the vote, real votes like it was done in the time of the cowboys and Indians, you would see how many reject this nonsense. I hope Kenya will continue to push and reject and not allow their little parades to be given rights that many of us would not even be able to do even with are normal ideas.",1
A great leader 💪🏽,0
Please stop raising this topic with Kenya. In 2022 the same news anchor is still raising this question with the new president... we&#39;re not interested Amanpour🥱 Respect our  decisions! 🙂,0

Is he saying that it is not an issue but if someone would to be caught kissing someone else of the same sex then its ok to arrest them or get them in some sort of legal trouble? Because if thats the case then yes that is a problem. There is something called minding your own business and someone likeing another person of the same sex has nothing to do with you. Someone please reply because I feel like I&#39;m missing something. If he is talking about marriage or people calling themselves some random gender then thats a different story, but if you support attacking someone whatever it is physically or legally for doing something that doesn&#39;t affect you one bit then yes that is an issue. I&#39;m not gay or anything but that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m going to start attacking someone because of it.",0
"What he just stated was absolutely true. You cannot make law in a republic that is 99% disapproved by the populace. The anchor lays the blame on him because she wants him to be a dictator and impose on the public in Kenya the gay agenda, whom she despises because of their disapproval.",1

"For anyone who disagrees with this man, I personally don’t think he’s saying that equality for the LGBTQ+ community isn’t an important issue overall. His focus is on Kenya, he was on CNN as a representative of Kenya and it is his job to represent his people. His stance is that in Kenya equality for the LGBTQ+ community isn’t nearly as big as a problem as it is in the western world mainly because of the Kenyan culture. If you don’t agree with the stance of the people he’s representing don’t go to the country. Just a different pov 🤷🏾‍♀️",0
"While He represents the will of his people, i don&#39;t think That is whats Happening in the first World. Everyone I talk to are so done with lgbtq Agenda pushed down our throats but somehow its what everyone is legit scared to voice. How can That be? The politicians love These topics bc noone loses when we push lgbtq stuff but if actual change is asked for the poor and under priviledged the politicians just try to beat around the Bush bc the rich pay them to not make any change That could hurt them... It&#39;s a mad world",1
I like this guy.,0
Well done to the president staying firm on his stance. Let the people of Kenya decide what issues need greater  attention  in their own country not what issues are creating havoc in whole other continent let alone in the neighbouring countries,0
This man is a absolute Chad,0
"LGBTQ members in America better quit crying about inequality when shit like this is happening to those people.. in America people are offended just because you don&#39;t agree with them being gay, people don&#39;t have to agree with you.... But you should be grateful that the people that don&#39;t agree with you, don&#39;t behave like this in America, you literally have it made!",1
"You don’t have to listen too hard to hear that he’s saying he only represents what 99% of Kenyans believe on the matter. He said after his presidency is up, he can freely share his personal opinion on the matter. What he’s saying is he’s no dictator.",0

"There not scared because it is there law, just like we have the death penalty, just because it&#39;s hidden, they do it in front of everyone but it is their law and it&#39;s no different than killing someone in any country. What because we don&#39;t see it makes it better, if being gay is a crime, they know the price is death. That&#39;s what real Muslims believe and even God before Jesus came to free us from the law said the price is death because it&#39;s sin. U should thank Jesus, he took ur place and nobody is killed for being gay because it&#39;s a sin God has to punish because it&#39;s a choice. We make the wrong choice, don&#39;t we die by the law of the land. Without laws u have no order. To them its normal but America thinks u can change the laws they make, to them its not cruel, they are only doing what Muslims were told to do and u can&#39;t change what he said even tho I believe he was a fake teacher, they don&#39;t and it&#39;s their law so get over it. U can&#39;t change it and they still kill u today 4 it",1

They can start thinking about social issues when they fix the economical ones first. I would say struggling to feed yourself takes priority over fighting for rights for gays and others.,0

And damn, what a good leader<br>“My decisions are based on the wants of my citizens, and the entire country literally said they don’t want homosexuality, regardless of my personal beliefs”. What does she not understand about that? He’s basing his choices off what all his people request, rather than tyrannically making laws influenced by his own emotion. The US is the US, Kenya is Kenya. Mind your own business lady.",1
"I&#39;m Bisexual and see a lot of people say it&#39;s a choice or whatever, but I&#39;m not in a country where it&#39;s a crime to be this way, but if being seen as disgusting, immoral, hated, so be it. I&#39;m not trying to force my way of life on anyone and just trying to survive like anyone else. I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m making it a choice to be Bi just to be seen as disgusting, but I&#39;d rather be seen as disgusting and keep doing what I&#39;ve been doing.

"I wish I was straight. It would be so much easier. I mean, I do like men, but I also like women, as well as all other identities. I just like people ( around my age, obviously ).<br><br>My dream is to marry the person I love, and either adopt or have biological children. But I am so terrified that my loved one and / or my children could be harmed because of the life we&#39;ve lived.<br><br>If I end up marrying a man, that&#39;s great! I can pretend to be someone I&#39;m not, ensuring the safety of my family. But I&#39;d just be lying to myself. If my husband wasn&#39;t already informed of the situation, how would I tell him?<br><br>Would it change the fact that I loved him / our children? No! I would still cherish them with all of my heart. But I am a very honest person, and keeping that part of myself hidden out of fear would make me feel like a liar. Like I was a fake.<br><br>I&#39;m so terrified. And my parents! My dad&#39;s adoptive family is open to it, but we&#39;re not sure about his birth family, and my mom&#39;s family is an absolute no. Around my dad&#39;s birth family, we just don&#39;t mention it. But around my mom&#39;s family, there&#39;s always a heavy pressure that we absolutely cannot bring it up.<br><br>I don&#39;t want to be shot in the streets because I wore a pronoun pin. I don&#39;t want my partner to get hurt because we went on a date. I&#39;m not even in my twenties yet. I don&#39;t want to die!<br><br>That&#39;s why we push so hard to be seen. Unfortunately, a part of our community has taken that message as an excuse to be awful. They scream and terrorize and justify it with &quot;representation&quot; and &quot;rights.&quot; But that&#39;s not what the majority of us want. We just want to exist without fearing for our lives. Some people take our name and use it to identify as an object or an animal, and it&#39;s disgusting. Neopronouns are a f*cking joke ( the xir / ze ones are debatable at best, but I think only people in the community should use them, and outside people can just use they / them as umbrella pronouns ).<br><br>Please, just let me exist.

"Homosexuality is a western invention.They , the west, is trying to prove that people are born gay, that its a matter of genetics. In islam there is no such thing as sexual categorisation. Any man could desire another man, it could happen to me to you , even to the prophets. Once the sahabas(companions of the prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him) asked the prophet if they could have sex with men war prisoner and the prophet forbid it. Were the sahaba gay? No, they were just far from their wives and they thought that they could commit sodomy with other man in halal way yet the prophet stopped them. If Allah didnt created women, probably Homosexuality could be halal. But Allah in his wisdom made Eve as wife of adam so that adam could have halal sex . If Allah would have not created women, then all men would have sex with each other. The strong would prey upon the weak . The world would be a big prison and we all know what happen when we incarcerate men together. Do they suddenly turn gay? People should ask themselves these question. But only the one who reason would understand.And one of His signs is that He created for you spouses from among yourselves so that you may find comfort in them. And He has placed between you compassion and mercy. Surely in this are signs for people who reflect. Surah rum aya 21",1

The more I learn about Eli the clearer it’s becoming that he/she/piece of shit.  Whatever it identifies as is a groomer and goes after vulnerable people. This person is targeting the trans community how is this person not in prison or at least charged with something? Just because this person is a trans person who regurgitates all of the nonsense the left pushes they are still supported by the media and will probably get away with this because of it. If Blaire did something like that she would already be charged with something and they would be celebrating her downfall. I’m just sayin.,1

They themselves admit that it is a mental distress. They don&#39;t really have a choice in their admittance of this when they bring up Suicide as an argument for why you &quot;should just let them do it.&quot;  And they even have claimed and harassed detransitioners with the very contradictory statement of &quot;you were never trans.&quot; even though the radicals are the ones that believe in Genderfluidity lol so by their own logic Genderfluid doesn&#39;t have real dysphoria either since one day they have dysphoria about being a man but the next they feel like neither, when in ALL confirmed cases of actual gender dysphoria it is ALWAYS from male to female or vice versa.

If Eli goes to a men’s prison, there’s going to be hardcore abuse toward her (which people will argue she deserves but it’s not just right). If Eli goes to a women’s prison, based on the history, there’s the possibility of abuse and rape toward the female inmates. <br>And if Eli does go to a men’s prison and gets abused it will be blasted all over the Left wing media, and if Eli goes to a women’s prison and abuses the female inmates it will not be covered at all. People are terrified of being labeled “transphobic.” <br>I propose a separate area for trans women only and a separate area for trans men only. <br>Anyways, I was thinking about this.",1

"The most important ‘affirmative’ medical care for young people that do not identify with the gender that they were assigned at birth is psychological help. There needs to be a distinction between neurodivergent and neuro typical young people that do not identify with the gender they were assigned at birth. Because they have different needs. Genuine trans gender people want to be normal, so they want to blend in to society, they want to get married, most importantly THEY WANT TO HAVE CHILDREN. That is not to say neurodivergent people do not want children. But, let’s be honest, neurodivergent people live in an alternate universe where their lives revolve around fantasy such as Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, World of Warcraft, cosplay, comic conventions, robots, alien life force, anime etc. That is why 76+ genders were invented, they were invented by neurodivergent people. Their lives are fabricated behind a computer and the internet. Neurodivergent people have every right to be themselves but they need to be accepted not surgically and  hormonally interfered with. They are often ‘transitioning’ to fit in with society, not because they feel like the opposite gender. Whoever is exploiting this should be absolutely ashamed of themselves.",1

One question why do u guys hate gay people? Cause I&#39;m confused what they do?,0
"There not scared because it is there law, just like we have the death penalty, just because it&#39;s hidden, they do it in front of everyone but it is their law and it&#39;s no different than killing someone in any country. What because we don&#39;t see it makes it better, if being gay is a crime, they know the price is death. That&#39;s what real Muslims believe and even God before Jesus came to free us from the law said the price is death because it&#39;s sin. U should thank Jesus, he took ur place and nobody is killed for being gay because it&#39;s a sin God has to punish because it&#39;s a choice. We make the wrong choice, don&#39;t we die by the law of the land. Without laws u have no order. To them its normal but America thinks u can change the laws they make, to them its not cruel, they are only doing what Muslims were told to do and u can&#39;t change what he said even tho I believe he was a fake teacher, they don&#39;t and it&#39;s their law so get over it. U can&#39;t change it and they still kill u today 4 it",1

Before I even watch this ..which is the saddest thing ever.. I don&#39;t understand why people are getting killed because they love somebody... That&#39;s all it is.. if you want it to be basically put.. they&#39;re killing because they love the same gender.... I don&#39;t know about anybody else .. but that&#39;s the most evilest thing ever.. I would think that Allah wouldn&#39;t like that.. I would think if anything why not let him take care of it not people of Earth if that&#39;s what they so choose if it&#39;s punishable then let the higher power deal with it if they would like to live that way let them live like that.. that&#39;s not for you to decide their fate.. I mean who would kill for love ?but the crazier question is who would want to get killed for love ?who would willingly put themselves in danger knowing that they could be killed but yet they still love? isn&#39;t that crazy.... And the next thing I&#39;m going to say is it&#39;s going to be never ending it will never stop the gay the trans the lesbian they&#39;ll keep coming.. so it&#39;s like a never-ending slaughter do you understand that? How many are going to get killed before you realize this?,0

My dad&#39;s adoptive family is open to it, but we&#39;re not sure about his birth family, and my mom&#39;s family is an absolute no. Around my dad&#39;s birth family, we just don&#39;t mention it.

These were actually VERY mild stories. I have read some horrible stories from Detransitioners that&#39;ll make you gag.,1
"man. i am a cis woman who has massive problems w introducing any kind of hormone into my body. i can no longer take hormonal bc because it fucks my head and body up so bad and completely changes how i operate as a person. day after pill, ill take it if necessary but there goes my grip on reality for an entire month or more. i also have pmdd with transient psychotic features so alltogether i have one of those bodies for whom any hormonal imbalance is very very serious/apparent. even if not everyone reacts in this way, i know from first hand experience that hormones should never be taken lightly or without rigorous research/preparation and the ability to be honest with oneself. for me this is accepting the need to be diligent about my cycle bc an unplanned pregnancy could happen a little bit easier for me off of bc. it is recording my mood and behavioral changes due to my natural hormonal fluctuations. and this is in the absence of introducing foreign hormones lol...if you arent prepared to accept a lot of risk and responsibility and the necesity of doing your due diligence you should not be able to procure these. just bc you arent sensitive to them doesnt mean that their effects are any less profound. literally harrowing how many people advocate for the ability to get hormones easily.",1
You found someone worse then Yaniv.,1
Why do you pretend you don&#39;t know the reason they allow this? it&#39;s because they want to reduce the population and the more gay people and the more people who chop up their private parts means the less people who will be breeding.,1
"So now, you&#39;re defaming. Congrats, you&#39;re a terrible person. No amount of &quot;BlAiRe WhItE iS aN aMaZiNg PeRsOn&quot; comments will try to convince otherwise me at this point.",0
The Alphabet Cult is still claiming there are no repercussions to giving children puberty altering medication.<br><br>Men can be feminine. Females can be masculine. There is no reason for ether to permanently damage themselves beyond the greed of the &quot;professionals&quot; and the selfishness of the &quot;friends&quot; socially pressuring them to do so.,1
I love you Blaire and I think you’re an amazing person. Thanks for bringing this issue to light and not being afraid to voice the truth,0
"Bodybuilders get locked up for taking steroids. Estradiol is a hormone replacement  therapy given to women who have had a total abdominal hysterectomy and/or going through menopause . We stopped giving it, so much, years ago due to risk of cancer. Now we reccomend bioidenticals, a more natural form of hormone replacement.  This is just sickening.  These doctors took an oat to &quot; due no harm&quot;. Theses hormones are going to totally destroy peoples heath. Cancer gonna skyrocket.  Wonder who will profit ???",1
"Wow! Blaire White either blatantly lying or doing zero research on the matter again? Shocker!<br>(Watch last video by Jessie Gender on the matter to know why, many things Blaire says are factually wrong)",0
You are also grooming children into the transcult. You&#39;re are not much different.,1
Any updates on Eli?This is so f&amp;*%n scary...,0
I hope there’s more LGBTQ+ fighting this predators and child abusers. It’s sad to see people “healthcare officials and hospitals” pushing this to childrens ❤️❤️❤️,0
I fucking love your realness,0
"long time liberal follow of yours. i definitely think sending drugs to kids illegally is disgusting, and dont understand how anyone can think otherwise.",0
Don’t you go beat yourself up Blaire you are the NO 1 most genuine NFG straight shooting trans Woeman I’ve seen online. Your a breath of hot fresh air babe ❤💕💯🔥🥰😍😘,0
"Temporarily dismissing all the other issues with this <a href=""http://idea.how/"">idea.How</a> could you even trust that what this person sent was what it was supposed to be and not some other drug or substance? <br><br>I feel like the rule of not touching your drink at the bar if you turn your back would apply tenfold to something like this. I could only truly trust drugs I got from a doctor or my pharmacy because at least if something went wrong it could be traced back to the source",0
"That&#39;s some properly guided disinformation. I really hope that one day you&#39;ll realise what you&#39;re doing here and I sincerely hope it&#39;s before you helped right-wingers destroy all the targets you help aim at. Because that&#39;s when they&#39;ll turn around and see you as their next target and you won&#39;t have anyone to protect you. If you don&#39;t think that&#39;s how it goes, read Niemoller&#39;s &quot;First they came&quot;. That&#39;s how fascism always goes. And at the end of the day, that&#39;s what this is and who you are - fascism and someone helping it to become mainstream.",0
I wish i knew Eli when I was 11 because maybe she would have had Leonardo Ninja Turtle hormones.,0
"I am detrans.  I had the mastectomy.  I regret it so much and in the first year of my detransition I would cry almost every day over the loss.  I grieve my healthy body before ‘gender affirming medicine’.  I also had mental health concerns, I was a teenager - I was in no state to make the decision to permanently alter my body in ‘gender affirming care’.  Yes, the ones pushing and promoting are absolutely the worst kind of human beings.",1
Without the knowledge of drugs you are taking it’s so bad for youth,0
"Are these the same psychiatric professionals who were giving people lobotomies 50 years ago?<br> Or in light of the appearance of homosexuality in up to 10% across the entire mammalian kingdom sending teens to &quot;straight camp&quot; for conversion therapy?<br> He&#39;s a nutter, but I have to side with Tom Cruise on the whole psychiatric community.",1
"I know I&#39;m a man. I know what a woman is. I think women brains and men brains are not the same. I suppose it is possible for a person to sincerely and actually be &quot;stuck in the wrong body&quot;.<br>  Even still, I am strongly opposed to all these procedures for fear of even ONE case suffering from dysphoria or mental disorder of some kind and, like these victims, would have grown out of it with talk therapy or just time. I can not imagine anything more horrifying than going through a medical procedure meant to &quot;fix&quot; you at the age of 14 only to discover it resulted in genital mutilation you have to live with your whole life. I guess I am opposed kind of like why I&#39;m against capital punishment; for fear of one innocent person being killed.<br>14 years old? Approved elective genital surgery? Hell, 8 years earlier, that kid &quot;identified&quot; as a firetruck or a princess. This is insane.",1
Now that all of these claims were debunked will you delete this video and apologize to eli,0
"The kid is right, though. Who&#39;s going to be attracted to her/him? Remember some transvestites that threw a tantrum about straight men not being attracted to them? I think they expect straight people to be into them, which will only happen, sorry to say, if the straight person is majorly disturbed.<br><br>I feel bad for these kids.",1
IM TRYING TO DO THIS POST IN CAPS BECAUSE WE NEED TO TALK ASAP . I AM VERY WELL KNOWN IN THE COMMUNITY AND I DIDNT EVEN KNOW ABOUT THIS PLEASE LETS TALK ASAP. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯✊️✊️✊️✊️✊️✊️✊️✊️✊️✊️✊️,0
"heart-wrenching. Next read the testimonies of men who have bottom surgery and the horrible, horrible experiences they have with  recovery, botched procedures, and the nighmarish practice of dilation. It&#39;s sickening and tragic what this ideology leads people to do.",1
Oh yeah this s***&#39;s great you know China just pushing fentanyl over the border? Yeah this is gonna work out great.,0
"Blaire! It is SO INCREDIBLY refreshing to see a transwoman who takes a sane and  brilliant view to today&#39;s issues dealing with transgenders in America today, especially when dealing with children. We love you!",1
5th video liked,0
Eli is corrupt and should be the last person in that position.,0
Watch the Jessie Gender video people,0
Blair...instagram is allowing people to sell thc vape cartridges in California on Instagram. I currently feel so ignored about this...aside from going to the sherriff...eff the pd...what else would you suggest? Any suggestions are welcome 🙏,0
"I’ve been all for trans rights and still am, but some of the stuff is scaring me for sure. My 14 year old daughter has like 4 friends tops. Tell me why all of them are either trans/gay or both. Wtf?! That can’t be statistically possible and it’s affecting my kid too. She is literally questioning because of all this shit. I don’t mind her finding herself but she’s been damn boy crazy for years. She’s not gay, it’s just what’s cool right now and it’s pissing me off. It’s a slap in the face to actual lgbt people. And now us parents are in this no man’s land where we try and be supportive but also have to like protect our kids from this crazy shit that’s permeating society",1
"It begs a concern that this might end up being a way for her to groom children and youth. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s her initial intent. I think she really wants to be a hero to the trans community. But with all child predators, the tempation will be too great.",1
"As someone who doesn’t agree with Blaire’s political views, &amp; despite the underhanded generalized transphobia sprinkled throughout the video… I think this is a great video. It’s the first one that actually comprehensively covers the <b>whole</b> issue about Eli/Elie and how she is a stain in the LGBT community, &amp; it’s people like her that make it hard for trans people (which the VAST majority of whom ALSO hate her &amp; shun her) to exist peacefully. She needs to face consequences for her actions, these kids need justice.",1
Nothing tragic here..Only bad ppl making bad choices..Accept who you are..They want to detrans so they will cry after to be trans again.. They are insane..Assume your choice and stop playing the victims.. Anyone logic wont do things like that..So now go cry to your cult,1
"First of all this person is fucking disgusting, vile, repulsive, pure evil. At first I&#39;m like &quot;worse than Jessica Yaniv?&quot; And holy shitt 😳 he (I refuse to call someone w a penis that brutally rapes women a she) deserves life behind bars or violent murder.  <br>So disgusting &amp; ironic that this &quot;activist&quot; chooses to go after specifically trans poc. <br>I&#39;m convinced that Google is run by leftist pedos atp. I&#39;ve been noticed this shit. Been seriously questioning their morals &amp; integrity for a while now.. this 100% confirms it. Throw a lot of social media right in there with it.<br>Hate that people are really ok with this, just shows the absolute degeneration of society. Just horrifying, all of it.",1
Blaire you are an amazing lady! I have just recently been introduced to you on YouTube. Keep on keeping on! I know so cheesy but that’s how I feel. 🥰,0
Pretty much all of this was taken out of context. It&#39;s incredible how conservatives LOVE to take information and hyperbole it to fit their agenda to gain views. That&#39;s  all you&#39;re really interested in Blair.,0
Is no one gonna mention taking the blue pill,0
"As a male born male, when I was a bit younger, just the MENTION of potentially taking prescribed testosterone to help deepen my voice was completely shutdown without question…",0
And now he’s on Dr Phil smh 🤦‍♀️,0
"Blair, I been a long time follower of yours and have admired you for years. Without you I would have not accepted trans people and saw their issues as real. Unfortunately you have turned into your rival Reilly where you don&#39;t give the full facts and have turned a blind eye on what doesn’t support your agenda. What makes it worse is that you will tear other people down in your own community to build up thise who want to harm your community like Matt Walsh. For this I will have to unsubsribe to your channels. I wish it didn&#39;t come to this but I&#39;m on a different path now and have let you go.",0
"For those who want a different angle on this story watch Jessie Gender&#39;s video. <br><a href=""https://youtu.be/cya2IyZmZOQ"">https://youtu.be/cya2IyZmZOQ</a>",0
Wow this person still on the internet and not banned? Disgusting😅,0
"I like Blaire and that there&#39;s at least some resistance to this stuff. But in it&#39;s deepest core she will eventually defend gender confusion because &quot;she&quot; is a biological man. You can&#39;t f.ex sit and drink on air and promote sobriety. <br>I kind of get for some reason what a nightmare it would be for Blaire to detransition, but at some point we all have to look in the mirror and accept what it really is. <br>Self delusion is natural because it&#39;s difficult to face who we truly are. <br>At some point reality is gonna catch up with us all whatever it is. You can&#39;t run from it because it&#39;s the shadow of yourself that turns as the light is directed at you.",1
We need to start blowing these gender clinics up😊,1
"This is random, but Libs means “liberals” right ?",0
Damn those fingers are manly.,0
"Blaire, you over-pumped the lips.",0
"Seems like as soon as a man claims that he&#39;s trans, or just not a male in general, they all of a sudden get a pass for multiple offenses. If Ezra Miller&#39;s getting away with the BS he&#39;s been doing (I use proper English, he&#39;s not a group of people), then why is anyone surprised by the offenses that this dude (IDC what gender he thinks he is) has been committing. Keep holding them accountable.",1
"you go girl, we need more people with the courage to stand and say what is the right thing and time..need to ask what are they getting out of it???  You&#39;re awesome...keep it going...",0
Carabello where did I hear that before...,0
"Blaire, please do a video on Keffels. That guy is an absolute lunatic that gets children to take DIY hormones.",1
"Eli Erlick has connections with Katie Couric, photos are on FB..  His family have connections so he is going to get away with his crimes. Democrats.",0
Eli Erlick is a straight guy who has hurt women. HE is a predator.,0
Check out The Detransition Diaries: Saving Our Sisters . . . :( 🙏,1
Eli Chapo Guzman is in the house now lol<br>but fr this is seriously disturbing,0
I’m sorry Blaire but I disagree completely.,0
I didn&#39;t even know who she was until one of my favorite content creators made a hate video about her. I sat there waiting for a reason to actually hate her....one never manifested so I subbed. They need to put their bs aside and save the kids.,0
"Everytime I see something about transgenderism, one phrase always comes to mind<br><br><b>”life is not a MMORPG where you can change anything on the whim, what you do cannot be reversed, it is inscribed onto the thread of fate forever”</b><br><br>These idiots would totally not understand this, they think they are ahead of nature, we aren’t in a cyberpunk era yet",1
"Well done, Blaire.",0
"People have been misgendering Erlick&#39;s victims, and it needs to stop. Danie Yun was not a woman. Danie Yun was a trans person who specifically used they/them pronouns, and had undergone top surgery for the purposes of gender affirmation. It is very important that people stop erasing the struggles of trans men and transmasc people who are raped by trans women, and whose accusations are silenced on the basis that men (and masculine people) cannot be raped by women. Erlick accused Danie Yun of &quot;transmisogyny&quot; for holding her accountable. It is a tactic of silencing victims that I have seen employed by trans women in the past. Stop misgendering Danie Yun in order to push the idea that Erlick exclusively targets women. Danie Yun&#39;s identity matters too. The experiences of transmasc and trans male victims matter too.",0
What in the what?<br><br>Why is this creature getting praise?,0
BLAIRE WHITE ARE YOU HIRING BY ANY CHANCE,0
"The trans culture seems like a dichotomy, on the one hand they want acceptance from everyone but with the same breathe they will silence any trans that don’t follow their narrative!!!! I’m soooo confused!!!!!",1
here on the recent comments to see the chasers thirsting over you,0
"The fact that Eli Erlick live in New York, and with all the rising crimes there and there is no accountability from the feckless District Attorney, don&#39;t hold your breath. Eli getting justice won&#39;t happen anytime soon. Sorry to have to say that.",0
"I wish conservatives would also push for a stop for male genital mutilation in the US (Circumcism). Kind of shows their bias when they ignore the big one, yet want to the more minor issue. Focus on both, otherwise you&#39;re a hypocrit.",0
"Receiving somebody else’s medication‘s is a federal offense. Prescribing or giving somebody else medication that is prescribed to another is a federal offense. They are not physicians and they are not qualified to do so. How is this not a punishable offense? My kids school can’t even give them a Tylenol without calling me but it’s OK to give children these medication‘s? Wow. This person should never ever be able to see the light of day again. Not only with the drug trafficking, but all of the other monstrous things that she has done. Unbelievable",0

This Eli guy reminds me of Keffals.,0
"That is all so f-ed up. The drugs, that&#39;s insanely dangerous. And love how she&#39;s been called the new face of feminism. Sure. Awesome. Nothing says &#39;I&#39;m a feminist&#39; like being accused of r*pe.",0
I think the DEA has bigger problems to deal with than this,0
"I would have DIED to get hormones for free like this as a teen… which is the problem. Being an adult now, nothing changed and I’m still trans, but if I’d done something like this and it turned out I was mistaken it could’ve ruined my life.",1
"This has never been about the LGB, it is about the &#39;T&#39;.  LGBs do not need hormones or surgeries nor do they promote it. And why do these freaks think these hormones should be handed out? It is b/c  medical practitioners are handing them out when they should not be doing it either.",1
"As a gay man this is extremely disturbing and very disgusting. All these pronouns and thousands of things you can label yourself to identify with- like wth! I remember when things were just so much more simpler. You were either Straight, Bi or Gay. What the h*ll do I look identifying as a Zir????! This sh*t is  starting to sound like Plant of Aliens. These people are not part of the LGBT community. I do not condone that behavior.",1
yoooo im trying to build muscle.<br>could really do with that free testosterone.<br><br>might pretend im a trans man,0
You belong to the FREAK SHOW!,0

Thank you for speaking out about this Blaire. I love that you give no shits.,0
I don&#39;t for a second believe that Eli thinks he&#39;s some kind of victim.  In fact I think it&#39;d the opposite. He only posted that message about how it&#39;s hard being a trans person for victim points.  The reality is that  he and others like him live a life of privelage where the FBI and police ignore their criminal activity.  Simply because they identify as a protected class.  For the love of God he&#39;s commitng a federal offense!  This all goes to show that if anything many minorities now experience privelage in our society.,1
"Eli needs to be in prison. Full stop. I&#39;ve reported them hundreds of times on social media. Instead of of standing against drug trafficking to minors, they remove any negative comments towards eli. We should be just as irate at social media platforms for protecting a rapist, drug trafficker, and groomer.",0
"Fellow leftist here! I completely agree with what you said about the word trans cushioning the blow. It&#39;s like just because the person is trans, it takes all accountability away. It&#39;s terrible. Equal punishment for the same crimes, regardless of gender. That&#39;s gender equality!!",1
"We let kids destroy their bodies, then they hate themselves. This community is a Toxic Parasite that needs to be forcefully removed. They are dangerous. Period. END OF DISCUSSION. if you don&#39;t think the same then you are a danger as well.",1
oh ffs. Lock him/her/whatever up,1
"And this Ladies and Gentlemen is what happens when true, responsible, accountable, qualified &quot;parenting&quot; is absent. Cell phones are raising our children, replacing a human&#39;s needs, purposes, missions, visions, inspirations, mental balance, and God.

Harriet Tubman was on that Sly shit not on that sick shit,0
Historians say when Constantinople was taken the nobles were busy indoors debating about the sex of angels. Isn&#39;t USA doing similar?,1
Isn&#39;t it obvious that gender &quot;problem&quot; is just a tool ? One of the tools which are in use to remodel society. It&#39;s obvious for at least 2 decades that they need more submissive and feminine society that is easy to lead by emotions but not by facts.,1
"We really need more lgbt individuals to address the problems within their community, otherwise people will think that the entire community is a problem.",1

😱😱😱😱😱😡🤬🤮What kind of person can be ok with distributing hormones like that was no big deal and then even to minors!?!,1
i really like your video you&#39;re a very good youtuber,0
This swine is being protected. It&#39;s actually one small part of a scheme to leave the LGBT hung out to dry. Out of left field will come a right wing resurgence (I have a faceboot for the mechanisms of division and the main culprit is the false left right paridgm). Sometime in 2023 the clown in the white home will be removed in a planned nationalist takeover. It will be harsh for any democrats. There will be a constitutional ferver complete with left wing witch hunts. America will become isolationist and enjoy a period of extreme prosperity but society will become even more sick and hateful to one another. As far as the left has been able to go so will the right and then some. It will be a Christian fundamentalist even puritanical administration that will go too far and further divide and destabilize the nation just as it has been planned to. Be who you want but don&#39;t identify in any of gov&#39;s ticking traps. Be good to others and yourselves and never follow leaders. Peace,0
"I remember a story I heard a long time ago, more than a decade I would say. <br>It was about a man whom was abducted by aliens and he said he managed to communicate with them. <br>He said he asked them; &quot;What are you?&quot; and they supposedly replied along the lines of them being humans from the distant future and were unable to reproduce. <br>This was the reason for the reported abductions in our time, and why abductees often reported having something harvested or stolen from them. <br>Their reproductive cells such as eggs and the little swimmers. I thought little of it at the time, it was just a story and it was an interesting perspective, albeit slightly familiar from some sci-fi schow I&#39;ve seen at some point in life. <br><br>But this is no longer a fiction in my mind, I truly believe this to be a possibility now. Going down this road, along with the other things causing issues in reproducing; this story is a completely plausible idea in less than a few hundred years. Radiation and electromagnetism, bad food and GMO food with the epicyte gene which attacks reproductive cells (put into corn, why?), the promotion of transgenderism and all the other agendas going on right now which actively affects human reproduction, is far from a conspiracy theory at this point. <br>It&#39;s the agenda - Population control. Say it Matt, don&#39;t be afraid to speak real truth, to real power. Instead of just making fun of mentally ill teenagers, that&#39;s easy prey. <br>Go for the big whales here, expose the real agenda and not just the surface stuff.",1

"I don’t affiliate with a political party. Usually I look both ways before finding out what I think is the truth in a story. I can surely say that with even those screenshots alone, there is enough damning evidence to put her ass in the can for life and that I don’t need to look at it both ways. Eli’s a monster, or perhaps worse.",0
&quot;Everything is free...no questions asked&quot;. THATS THE PROBLEM!!!,0
I am NOT ok with perverted people. But you’re surely a boy ngl,0
Parents are supposed to protect their children from doing stupid shit like &quot;transitioning&quot; or thinking they can actually become the other gender. Has anyone considered the real possibility that if they were born the other gender they would still be dissatisfied with their current gender and would be prompted to transition? Just because you&#39;re a girl and not a boy doesn&#39;t mean you need to transition and just because you&#39;re a boy and not a girl doesn&#39;t mean you need to transition. I feel like no matter what you were born as you would want to be the other. Have you considered this? Just be who you are.,1

Its amazing how Pedophilia and Child Abuse is becoming as normal as the Average American citzen using their Smartphone on a dailybasis. (maybe not that far).

To the people who believe that allowing a stranger off the Internet to give your child drugs is a good idea ask yourself if you would be okay with a stranger giving your kid meth. In order to be OK with one you have to be OK with the other. So either you’re a hypocrite or you don’t actually believe this is okay.,0
So many of the trans women are trending. I transitioned before trans YouTubers . I’ve been on hrt 15 years.,1

"Hello Blaire, I have been watching your channel for a long time. I could genuinely say you are one of the few(if not the only) ones that sustain their opinions through logic and overwhelming intelligence which seem to be lacking in today’s society.

"I had a client who was a very attractive female who, after two &quot;counseling sessions&quot; decided to take testosterone and start her transition to becoming a male. Soon after she started growing facial hair she went into seclusion and besides talking to her sister who informed me how these drastic decisions ruined her family I haven&#39;t seen or heard from her since",1
I like how we believe texts and DM&#39;s with no actual evidence...Americans..smh.,0
America has always been weird with drugs. Being in Canada watching your channels you could be enjoying a family sitcom and when the commercials come on it’s just drugs and supplements. <br><br>Regardless of what you think in terms of people from other countries minding their own business these things have no borders. Apparently in America it’s very common for people to be prescribed medication for their mental illnesses but they can skip out on the therapy part of it… in other parts of the world medication and therapy go hand and hand… so when you hear people talking like Trisha Paytas about what they have and what they’re on but they’re not in therapy it’s a little sus…<br><br>Also imagine being prescribed medication for a mental Illness. That’s usually something that’s fundamental to a lot of people’s well-being. I wouldn’t be comfortable whatever the case with sourcing medication online through social media…,0

"I recently had a member of their community irrationally lash out at me because I won&#39;t allow her to normalize my children (9 &amp; 10 years old) with talking about lesbians. She labeled me a bigot and a homophobe after personally attacking my religion, my family and my home. The problem is, she is my 17 year old step-daughter. Am I wrong in not wanting my young daughters to be acclimated to the sexual terminology she attempted to redefine as &quot;not sexual&quot;?",1

"Why aren&#39;t kids taught how to actually love themselves and their bodies? There is no baby that is born thinking &#39;this body is wrong.&#39; These &#39;clinics&#39; shouldn&#39;t groom kids but actually help them explore why the body they were born with is awesome. Instead doctors are allowing kids to change their bodies like swiping on Tinder. Let them experience it until they&#39;re adults when they&#39;ve got enough knowledge to make big changes if they need to. Imagine a society made of a generation grown up with healthy, functional education that understands real self-acceptance. USE COMMON SENSE!",1

"This isn&#39;t even safe for adults. I&#39;m an actual woman with slightly elevated blood pressure and my doc didn&#39;t think it was safe for me to take estrogen to control my fibroid symptoms. This isn&#39;t even taking into account people with autoimmune disorders. <br><br>Blaire, you&#39;re a man. Eli is a man. But if y&#39;all are adults who want to alter your bodies to appear female and you accept the risks and also that women might not accept you that&#39;s one thing. But that&#39;s not what&#39;s happening now. People are being told that they can change sex with no consequences. <br><br>No one can change sex. And there will be profound consequences.",1
lmao its literally only a matter of time before blaire detransitions... equating &quot;thinking shes a girl&quot; to having poor mental health is the epitome of confusion,1
"The thing that pisses me off the most about this is when I point to these examples alphabet people just wave it off and say &quot;well they were never really trans&quot;. You don&#39;t get it, they thought they were because of your rhetoric and glamorizing of being trans is what&#39;s causing this.",1

Pray for the young women highlighted here. God is the Redeemer. Pray He brings something good out of all this for these poor little girls who were abused in this way. They need some hope and purpose. This is heartbreaking! The lawsuits need to hit hard and fast until doctors fear the repercussions of this abuse more than they fear the mob and name-calling. And then states need to make the medical transition of minors illegal.  Texas has the right idea.,1
"People in the future will laugh at how in our times the only options given to people with gender dysphoria were bodily mutilation and taking hormones. <br>There must exist a substance which would cure gender dysphoria, or make it less intense. If someone here has the knowledge, please tell me. I&#39;d like to know. I&#39;m not planning to deal it. I just wanna know.",1
I am a libertarian mostly and I follow you now and then cause you make sense....   how hard it that?,0
"I saw this idea in another comment, and I want to second it. It’d be awesome if there was an advocacy group/organization that supported detransitioners, provided them with resources, and gave them a place to share their stories.<br><br>If people in this position feel more empowered, it might help them mentally — and it’ll help the average person for safer in labeling these surgeries as child abuse.",1
"The community is a giant echo chamber that baits people in by telling them transitioning will make everything better. If you dare step out of that chamber, it is met with immediate hospitality.<br><br>Cracking your “egg” as they call it is not brave. Realizing that egg is actually a rotten illness and will lead to despair if you give in, then throwing it away is brave.",1
"Wait, they’re “trying to get the police involved”? Why is she not in jail? This is child abuse, breaking felony drug trafficking laws, grievous bodily harm, serious assault (maybe culpable homicide-not sure of US laws) and exploitation of minors (at the very least). Alone with a lot more. The person needs to be doing hard time.",0
The more I learn about Eli the clearer it’s becoming that he/she/piece of shit.  Whatever it identifies as is a groomer and goes after vulnerable people. This person is targeting the trans community how is this person not in prison or at least charged with something? Just because this person is a trans person who regurgitates all of the nonsense the left pushes they are still supported by the media and will probably get away with this because of it. If Blaire did something like that she would already be charged with something and they would be celebrating her downfall. I’m just sayin.,1

However, your videos do not make me feel ignorant or stupid. In fact, the opposite. I love to learn and like to think i have a very open mind,  especially about things I don&#39;t really understand.  I&#39;d like to express my gratitude  for your incredible insight, wonderful open-mindedness and balance regarding the current issues surrounding the trans community and society in general. Knowledge is something I value and it would be be so easy to fall into the extreme opinions of either side. Your videos are so refreshing and thought-provoking in all the right ways. I admire your approach to having conversations like these. You are intelligent, objective and courageous, At risk of being attacked by saying this, I was 2 videos in to your channel before even realising you were trans. Aesthetically speaking you are probably one of the most beautiful women in the world I have ever seen. I even saved a video of the work you&#39;ve had done to take to my cosmetologist, not only because I love the perfection of the work  you&#39;ve had done, but because you explained it so beautifully and above all, honestly. I&#39;m so happy I found you. You are truly an educator,  above all. A beautiful one at that, inside and out. Much love from Australia xxx",0

And it&#39;s a very attractive proposition, because as soon as a kid announces they&#39;re something other than they were born, they&#39;re now part of a group that tells them how &quot;amazing&quot; and &quot;brave&quot; they are.  <br>     Misery loves company.",1

"This is so much like the human experimentation the Nazis used to do years ago….watching the tv show about a young male to female trans patient, I was shocked when the mom asked the surgeon who was also trans if she had done many of these surgeries and it was like, “well, a couple”…and they went ahead anyhow, probably pushed by the show’s producers, fudging their way through the surgery with a lot of oh-oh oops comments that were pretty scary.  Things fell apart a couple of times and had to be repaired, and now (s)he is 100 pounds overweight and practically catatonic with chronic fatigue and depression from issues that never got resolved by the surgery.

I cried for this poor child. This is wrong if a kid cannot consent to tattoo a child cannot consent to not being real therapy and have people manipulate them into being trans and also allowing them to consent to these permanent changes. Two things can be true it can be a positive things for adults to feel safe expressing themselves but this is disturbed and disgusting to push this on children you can have some thing that is overall good and it can be co-opted to do other bad things if this group can’t stand criticism they don’t deserve to have the standing that they do. They don’t seem compassionate at all unless it serves their narrative and the women who get impregnated in prisons the poor children who are not able to make decisions like this do not have an understanding of gender and to be forced to live as a boy or a girl based on simply being a feminine or masculine child is disgusting people are taking away expression.,1
I&#39;ve been watching this channel for several years and there have been some sickening topics but I think this portion of this episode has been the most harrowing I have ever seen. I even went to the r/detrans subreddit and it&#39;s all the same. I feel as though I can confidently say that transgenderism is the most evil ideology in human history.,1

"Why is it always immediately to &quot;affirming&quot; care? Why is it never.....affirming if the person may actually be helped by transition? Why don&#39;t we affirm the reason WHY they may feel this way and ask that in therapy? Why do they need to avoid the period of TESTING as fast as possible? They themselves admit that it is a mental distress. They don&#39;t really have a choice in their admittance of this when they bring up Suicide as an argument for why you &quot;should just let them do it.&quot;  And they even have claimed and harassed detransitioners with the very contradictory statement of &quot;you were never trans.&quot; even though the radicals are the ones that believe in Genderfluidity lol so by their own logic Genderfluid doesn&#39;t have real dysphoria either since one day they have dysphoria about being a man but the next they feel like neither, when in ALL confirmed cases of actual gender dysphoria it is ALWAYS from male to female or vice versa. But never &quot;male to neither&quot;. <br><br>How do you feel dysphoria over wanting what doesn&#39;t actually objectively exist? Being genderfluid/nonbinary has zero expectation of appearance or even a requirement to change your appearance or name. They don&#39;t make any sense.",1

"This is the saddest thing I&#39;ve heard in a long time. The only way we will be able to put an end to this thing is if the people who were so severely abused and ruined by these people start suing them until there is nothing left of this horrific business. It doesn&#39;t even have to be the majority. If enough people sue these monsters into the ground, nobody will dare do this to any more people for fear of being sued for everything they have.<br><br>It&#39;s just so sad, because it preys on girls when they are at their most emotionally vulnerable. I don&#39;t blame these girls for not wanting to be a girl. I wouldn&#39;t want to be a girl while going through puberty either, it sounds AWFUL. But this is worse than awful, it&#39;s hell. That, and I&#39;m convinced that it&#39;s a social contagion. Many of these people only want to transition because they see people doing it on TikTok, and girls are very susceptible to emotions that make them want to feel like they are part of a social group. They are more sensitive to negative emotions than men, and they will do anything to gain a feeling of one-ness with others. They are not in a position to make a rational decision, they are too emotionally volatile and confused at this stage of their life. When their hormones stop raging and their emotions calm down a bit as they reach adulthood, they realize how bad of an idea it is.<br><br>I want to know how we got to this stage. Why the hell does anyone think it&#39;s a good idea to so recklessly tamper with human biology at the most important developmental stage of their life? Hormones are powerful. These people have played God and thought they could shape a human being however they saw fit and not see any consequences. Well, here are the consequences. I can only hope that by the time I have kids, this practice is destroyed. And I pray for those who are victims of this. They have been thrust into a hell that is going to be very hard to escape. We need as many people as possible working to mitigate the damage as soon as possible. They need to form support groups, and they need to be given a place where they can heal their minds and souls as much as possible. I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s mostly too late for their bodies, I imagine, but if they realize their mistake soon enough, maybe it wouldn&#39;t be impossible to help them.",1

"Somebody please help us conservative therapists who are hogtied in our profession to even help these kids question their transness. There’s so much legislation and pressure from our liberal professional leadership and the liberal states that we live in to affirm these children that I’ve had to take off of my website that I help with questioning sexuality because I am not trying to get arrested for not affirming their transness. I was trained to not affirm someone’s mental illness but to help them get to the bottom of it and learn to live in the body that they have. Other therapists will just not come forward because we are terrified that we will lose our license, that we will be arrested, that we’ll be sued,  and we know that if we are shut down, what hope at all do these kids have for any kind of professional to use known mental health practices to help them. I really want to help children and adults who want to Detransition but we need lawmakers and lawyers and celebrity figures to get behind us because we can’t do this on our own. We will be crushed. We have seen others get crushed and we are terrified that will happen to us. Not all of us can just rush out and throw our career aside to take this Juggernaut on. We have families we have to support we have other community members that require our help. We need someone like Matt Walsh to step forward and help us. Maybe Jordan Peterson could help us. Somebody please this is our cry for help as true therapists.   I pray every single day that God will show me someway or that will inspire others to help us. I feel like I’m just kind of hiding out until that happens so that I can leap forward with my arms open professionally and say that I am able to help detransitioners. If I can’t help my own niece who transitioned into a man maybe I could help others.",1
"The trans topic really makes my head spin. It turns everything we know upside down and complicates things. Here’s an example of what I’m talking about:<br><br>Does Eli go to a men’s prison or women’s prison? If Eli goes to a men’s prison, there’s going to be hardcore abuse toward her (which people will argue she deserves but it’s not just right). If Eli goes to a women’s prison, based on the history, there’s the possibility of abuse and rape toward the female inmates. <br>And if Eli does go to a men’s prison and gets abused it will be blasted all over the Left wing media, and if Eli goes to a women’s prison and abuses the female inmates it will not be covered at all. People are terrified of being labeled “transphobic.” <br>I propose a separate area for trans women only and a separate area for trans men only. <br>Anyways, I was thinking about this.",1

"The most important ‘affirmative’ medical care for young people that do not identify with the gender that they were assigned at birth is psychological help. There needs to be a distinction between neurodivergent and neuro typical young people that do not identify with the gender they were assigned at birth. Because they have different needs. Genuine trans gender people want to be normal, so they want to blend in to society, they want to get married, most importantly THEY WANT TO HAVE CHILDREN. That is not to say neurodivergent people do not want children. But, let’s be honest, neurodivergent people live in an alternate universe where their lives revolve around fantasy such as Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, World of Warcraft, cosplay, comic conventions, robots, alien life force, anime etc. That is why 76+ genders were invented, they were invented by neurodivergent people. Their lives are fabricated behind a computer and the internet. Neurodivergent people have every right to be themselves but they need to be accepted not surgically and  hormonally interfered with. They are often ‘transitioning’ to fit in with society, not because they feel like the opposite gender. Whoever is exploiting this should be absolutely ashamed of themselves.",1

Amazing how they want to act like these drugs don’t have serious and horrible side effects. London shut down one of there biggest trans clinics cause of the harm to minors. One 15 year old kid has the bones of a 70 year old person cause of puberty blockers and not having there bone density tested. That child is in a lot of pain now and there is nothing that can be done. We can’t reverse it so he will have problems for the rest of his life and can never live a normal life again. It’s sickening adults are trying to get kids to take drugs with horrible side effects.,1

"All this flippancy about regulations is scary &amp; infuriating. It reminds me of my own nearly-fatal, medication-related incident. When I was younger, I was on The Pill. My doctor knew, because she was the one that prescribed it. My mother knew, because I had told her about the symptoms I was having that led me to consider it. But even still, 8 months later, I ended up in the ER unable to breathe because the meds had caused blood clots to form in my legs that then traveled to my lungs. I could have died. So many women die every year from that exact complication. If I had been taking meds given to me by some random person, if I had been keeping it quiet from my parents, I absolutely would have died that night. But my mom knew, was able to speak for me when I couldn&#39;t, and the ER team was able to take that knowledge and act quickly &amp; concisely. People that want to give out pills to kids (be it birth control, hormones, the abortion pill, whatever), in secret and without any regulation or oversight, want those children dead. Plain and simple. They want them dead.",0

It was rare and mostly effected boys.",1
Part of the reason why this person is getting away with doing what there doing without getting more public outcry then what there getting is the fact that they are transgender and that there portraying themselves as being some sort of Robinhood like figure who is working in opposition to the law for the good of a group of people who are deemed as being oppressed and marginalized granted I understand that trans people/trans youth are not really being treated the best by various people but doing the type of thing that this person is doing particularly in the long run is most likely about to do a whole hell of a lot more harm then what it does good.,0

"I&#39;m not a detransitioner, thank God, but people tried to groom me into it when I was going through my darkest times. I suffer from a condition called puberphonia, so my voice didn&#39;t develop.

Thank God, I already had my mind made about my identity, and I already understood and followed my faith (as a Christian), or else, I could have been influenced by them.<br> The first girl&#39;s case is bad, and I can say this from experience. When I open my mouth, it makes me cringe when I hear my voice. I tried speech therapy, but it was not successful, so I think my only choice is surgery in the future. She still can get a female voice by submitting herself to the thyroplasty type IV surgery, but IT WON&#39;T BE THE SAME AS WHAT SHE HAD. Even though the surgery can help with the voice, it will never be the same due to the influence of testosterone during her puberty, and I&#39;m sad for her since I can still bet on the surgery to help me get my natural voice, but she can&#39;t. Her voice will never return to what it was in the past.",1

This is exactly why gender affirming clinics should be illegal because they are not looking out for the best interests of those questioning themselves and seeking help.

If people are pushing you to surgery as a way to discover your true identity, then they don&#39;t have your best interest in mind.",1

"I transitioned at 21 and regretted the whole thing by 25. Luckily I was able to come back and rebuild my femininity, but I live knowing that I will never be able to breast feed my future children. I can&#39;t imagine having to deal with this cruel fate at 19 or younger. Thank you Matt Walsh for sharing the stories of women and girls like me. Sadly there will be many more to come, and we must do everything we can to prevent the next generation from suffering the same fate",1

your discussing depravity while simultaneously pretending you are a girl... we dont want your takes to support us if you just going to be a hypocrite,1
The doctors will manipulate the parents too.  &quot;Do you want a live Son or a dead Daughter?&quot; they will ask.   Not letting them know they are more likely to commit suicide after transitioning than before.,1
"People like Eli use &quot;LGBTQ&quot; as a shield and many fall for it. They can literally do anything they want and if they get called out, all they have to do is yell &quot;Transphobe&quot;.. It&#39;s the new &quot;Racism&quot;",0

It&#39;s ladies like you that  affirm my knowledge (for lack of a better word) of myself. But apparently just like you I get so frustrated at people you know that obviously need some help upstairs being put on a pedestal instead of on a couch.

I fear that some will never recover. I used to believe that the trans suicide rate was due to a lack of acceptance. Now I know better so I pray as hard as I can. Dear God, please wrap them in your loving arms and keep them safe from the monsters who wear faces of concern.",1
There was a time when I thought about transitioning. Glad I never did it. Love being a woman,1

"Omg ! It is so refreshing to hear you speak common sense about this issue, I came here thinking you would be just another apolegest for kids on chemicals, and you actually are very level headed and intelligent.

And we have to be able to call out any unethical behaviour on both sides of the political parties. I&#39;m on the left but I do not think that Children should be given life ultering drugs when kids can change identitys a lot in they&#39;re small life&#39;s.",0
When you target kids you deserve the consequences regardless of how harsh and cold it will be.,0
It&#39;s disgusting the way these &quot;doctors&quot; lie to parents and tell them their kids will commit suicide if they don&#39;t allow them to medically &quot;transition&quot;.<br><br>It&#39;s emotional blackmail and a blatant lie. <br><br>Any data that makes it through the trans / woke blockade shows the exact opposite.<br><br>I.e. that messing with their hormones and mutilating their bodies is more likely to cause suicide than prevent it.,1

Blaire I&#39;ve never commented on a video before... Sadly you said it. If this person lives in nys they won&#39;t ever be charged.<br>.

"Eli is from a town next to mine. Since our towns are small, and very rural there were very little resources for LGBTQ youth. My town is the seat of the county so most of the available resources were here, and I volunteered for them. When I met Eli, he was quite dismissive and seemed to care more about the visibility than the actual work. At events are conferences everyone from community heads to speakers would pitch in and help set up but Eli only ever showed up to speak.<br>I got the distinct impression that everyone thought Eli was this golden poster child and shining example and deserved a pedestal. <br>I maybe that&#39;s why nothing has been done.

Then she got drugged at a bar and wound up marrying the guy.  and I was taken out of the slum and lived in your world where I was hauled off hundreds of miles and abanbon.  how much would you pay for this story?  I was totally able to fall in love at first sight in kindergarten.,0
"LOL!!! I love the sass! Oh crap, sorry i said that too early ...so sad for Danie!",0
Where does she live? We need to call the police department,0
🤣🤣 that lip gloss is perfect,0
It&#39;s simply amazing what people do these days in the name of &quot;helping&quot; others.,0
My question is why are there so many extra prescriptions? <br>Hmmm 🤔,0
This is just wild!!!! 😳😳,0
"My family wonders why I&#39;m so militant and stonewall in my repulsion and dislike of the radical left, being all democrats themselves. This is why. This is what it leads to. I hope after the cultural purge is over, every single person responsible for promoting this trash is held accountable with prison time.",0
"Can you invite some of these victims to join you on a special? Their stories must be heard, and they are worth more than their reddit post.",0
"Yes! There’s true victimization, not patients.",0
"Not a conspiracy theorist, but someone who can read the times. Some people feel there are too many humans on earth, and have taken measures to correct this problem in their eyes. Once these people who are truly suffering make the change it&#39;s no longer possible for them to reproduce. Destruction of family, marriage, and the lowest rates of child births in human history are also signs. How about global pandemics? Margret Sanger wanted to sterilize Black Americans, but settled on creating Planned Parenthood and aborting them. With blaming human populations for climate change, or natural resources being unsustainable. This justifies their horrific beliefs which allows them to remove who they decide. God isn&#39;t in any of their minds nor beliefs. Killing is a sin, as well as harming a child. Jesus said anyone harming a child will wish they had never been born. Prisoners treat those who harm children rather quite harshly often even death. The left thinks we are deaf, dumb, and blind which might lead to serious crimes in the not so far reality. If they allow this then they need to remove drinking age laws, and legalize all drugs.",0
Thanks for not doing what most people do on YouTube. You don&#39;t censor words like &quot;suicide&quot; or &quot;kill myself&quot;. Let the people who support these crimes against children hear these words.,0
They sang that they were coming for our children. Did you really believe they would be satisfied with getting &quot;gay marriage&quot;?! There are NO brakes on this slippery slope to hell.,1
"Why not feature a single person from the 95% of trans people who are happier after they transitioned, and which prevented them from committing suicide? Why is this tiny minority the ONLY ones who matter? Right, cause that&#39;s what serves your agenda, not objectivity. I wonder if in other situations, when the 95% suit your agenda, would you focus EXCLUSIVELY on the rest and pretend the vast majority doesn&#39;t exist? Of course not. Maybe make it balanced and talk to some happy trans people as well. You know, the majority.",0
"How did our society decide a child is too young to have sex, but IS old enough to attempt to change his sex?",1
"I think there might be a link between those that believe the world is overpopulated and those brainwashing kids into believing they&#39;re gender dysmorphic, after all the puberty blockers do make one sterile.",1
What happened to the times when we had things to do which eliminated the possibility of wondering if you were a boy or girl.,1
😭,0
"The Nazis took little children and sent them to the gas Chambers and even would put them in wagons and roll them right into the fire pits. Alive, screaming. What is the difference? There is none. These children are being sacrificed, these people know what they&#39;re doing and they don&#39;t care. These people that are doing this know the statistics, they know that most of these kids grow out of this. They want to create a mass amount of people that are mentally ill, that are suicidal, that hate themselves. It&#39;s not just the money from the transitioning, it&#39;s the money from the therapy, and the years of counseling that many of these people will need if they don&#39;t commit suicide. These people are sick and they need to be stopped. They need to be in prison.",1
"Uh, if you do not see the connection to over medicalization and pharmaceuticalization in general that has been happening for decades, you might think that trans programming is an isolated phenomenon. NO, it&#39;s so much bigger. Did you sleep walk through cofed mass formation psychosis psyops that debilitated people mentally and physically and killed them?! Same mass formation psychosis techniques being employed. Climate change, same mass formation psychosis techniques being employed. Big money cancer industry - same mass formation psychosis techniques being employed. THINK. Do you really think this is the first instance. You don&#39;t have to be a historian, you just have to know our socioeconomic, political and cultural history to understand what&#39;s happened and what has happened in the past. This type of atrocity is being normalized and legalized. So called historians may call it good in the books. We were smart and knowledgeable enough to stop Hitler but Hitler was just a puppet for multinational corporate monopolist globalists. FDR and Churchill made an unholy alliance with Stalin and Patton was against that alliance. We did not need Stalin according to Patton. Coincidentally, Patton was killed after the war. No longer necessary and he had too much integrity and spoke his mind. Do a case study and historical study on multinational corporate conglomerate, Siemens - you know, the ones who manufacture industrial wind turbines. Do historical research on Bayer. The globalists are winning right now and they have their puppets in place like Biden and Trudeau. Prince Charles and Klaus Schwab head up WEF. This goes real deep. Charles is the descendant of King George and it&#39;s payback time. We, the peasants are nothing but experimental lab rats, useful idiot tools, serfs, slaves and easily expendable fodder to eliminate.",0
Well done putting it out there. Kids need saving,0
The fact is if you take a thousand of these kids and even a fraction of them are going to find out later on that they did the wrong thing and regret it and commit suicide or be suicidal then it&#39;s the wrong thing to do. And the numbers are way higher than that! We don&#39;t send people to the slaughterhouse and expect them not to be slaughtered. This is being done on purpose. We need to end all transitioning and hormone therapy for children under the age of 18. All of it.,1
"These aren&#39;t evil people, Matt. Evil implies motivation. They aren&#39;t TRYING to ruin lives, they think they&#39;re doing good. It&#39;s not evil to be stupid and misinformed. I&#39;m NOT saying what they&#39;re doing isn&#39;t awful.<br><br>It&#39;s sickening but...the best way to change minds is firm disagreement with understanding. Maybe some legislature.",0
I’ll bet all I own that detransitioner stories would never be made available by groomers to kids,1
This is an extremely important video and I hope you make more videos where you read more of these people&#39;s comments. Becausd it will save some children from ruining their lives.,0
"When in all of history was there ever a society where it he cost of housing was so high, it was impossible to pay off your mortgage before you die and the loans had to be transferred to your children? Those kinds of societies aren’t written about or talked about much so no, the future, what ever that looks like won’t be taking about us and these issues. Sadly they won’t learn",0
They are getting loans that&#39;s why,0
"What&#39;s the legal situation? Can&#39;t the kids, when they grow up, demand millions and millions of compensation from the doctors? Obviously that won&#39;t bring their life back. But maybe those doctors will think twice if they want to continue like that.",0
They used to stick leeches on a person in the 1800s...    I see the correlation.,0
what happened to the world that now everyone is so obsessed with sexual orientation?,1
That hurt.,0
"How it happened is very simple - it&#39;s a mass mania that is the culmination of decades of leftist cultural disruption. When they ask how did people let it happen, the answer, also simple, is that, 1st, the left always pushes their agenda harder than others, so the culture is disrupted, little by little, more and more and, like the slowly boiling frog, no one realizes the great danger approaching until the mania has already begun.<br><br>2nd, after the fact, short of jailing or killing people, there&#39;s no way to stop a mass mania other than to wait until it dissipates. It dissipates through resistance to it, but it can&#39;t stopped short without physical restraint, i.e., imprisoning or killing perpetrators. There&#39;s obviously no stomach for or thought of that at this point.",0
"Hitler, Goebbels and Dr. Mengele only dreamed of a programmed mass that clamors to be experimental lab rats, Frankenstein monsters, and  expendable fodder.",0
We need detransitioners to do talks at schools and in MSM.  No one is mentioning these cases where kids are hearing and watching,1
These stories are horrifying and heartbreaking. People pushing this ideology on children are absolutely under the influence of a demonic spirit and the spirit of the antichrist. God help us. We need to save and protect our children.,0
This will save lives.,0
"These are the byproducts of a culture saturated by promescuity, self absorption, superficiality, worldliness.  The victim card has an expiry date.  <br><br>To rise above such abuse takes maturity, power under control, charity in action, resolve to forgive, and the divine gift of faith.  There is no other effective remedy.",0
The doctors that do this are criminals @vanderbilt,0
I grew up with several &quot;Tom Boys&quot; who today are lovely wives and mothers...and grandmothers. Thank GOD we didn&#39;t have this kind of insanity back then!  The Leftists have completely lost their minds....or have been possessed by demonic forces beyond our comprehension.,1
i thinnk its optimistic that we wont be even more monsterously delusional in the future. We talking about a time period where you probably wont have to live in the real world anymore. Everything will be virtual. You can live as a woman in a virtual world without question or ur gender irl,1
People have been jailed for giving someone drugs that made that person doing crazy stuff because they were seen as helping or whatever. And affirming or pushing for a transition especially for anyone in lower age should be a crime too. For mental health they say medication isn&#39;t the solution but a crutch or help and working on yourself is the real solution. Then how come drugs and surgery is THE solution all of a sudden....crazy!,0
Blame the school systems too along with the parents and medical industrial complex. Blame multinational corporate owned and run MSM and all the elitist career politicians and bureaucrats promoting and legalizing this atrocity and crimes against humanity.,0
&quot;how could this happen?&quot; Social media is how it happened.,0
I think you’re wrong when you say” I won’t be around to say I told you so” I believe that you will be around. We will start to see the full effect of this madness in the the next 10 to 15 years maybe sooner.,0
"The Benjamin Boyce YouTube channel is one of the most detailed studies of the whole mass formation psychosis psyops to sterilize, castrate, mutilate and amputate these victims and make them medicalized and chronic suffering patients for life.",0
Criminal is a better word than tragic. Those poor kids.,0
if you are 21 and want to transition then its your choice you are a fully grown adult but if you are a kid and want to transition shut the hell up you are a stupid kid and those are things you dont understand,1
Who would want to ruin their body? Like you dont want to fuck up your future self. Just be you. The peer pressure is stupid and some of it is crazy people getting a kick out of the stupid bs that comes after.,0

"Just when gays, lesbians and transgenders are accepted, now their position is back where they were before. They&#39;re back at square one. I miss the old LGBT. All their hardwork is nothing now because of this new wave of LGBT.",1
"I have yet to hear a happy ending in any of these trans stories, not one. Every one I have heard turns in to a horrendous experience filled with nothing but regret, and there&#39;s no going back.",0
Lopping off body parts and sterilizing yourself will come back to haunt who does it.  And likely their families too from guilt.,0

"Let&#39;s do something to help this kid, Matt open a go fund me as you did for the Abuela, I&#39;ll gladly donate with you as the spearhead. So by the time he is an adult, he can take charge of his life and put it back on track.",0
"Why not have the Surgeons, Drs and everyone invovled sign something  that they will be held 100% responsible , good or bad? And if they balk, then you have your answer, that they don’t even stand behind their beliefs .<br>Now my thoughts on that shop teacher in Canada,t he one with the huge prosthetic  breasts, if she is now a woman ,would she not have to reapply ,for the job? Shes a new teacher ? Im serious here,their all going for throats Ellen Page is dead Elliott page  is now ,,if their previous identity is dead, their not the same person then how is it that they are still benefitting  from the dead person the were before ? Don’t call me Ellen Page but yet has no problems using that to keep careers ? Reap the money and accolades .acting roles ? Same with the shop teacher ,if he is dead , or no longer how is it she can slide in and take over ? Should she not have to apply , go back to school get all the degrees ?",1
This is entirely too sad. I pray we as families can strengthen in order to shield our kids until we get this nonsense out of our society!,0
"I’m not a conservative but he’s right. I’m tired of language like “gender affirming care” that trans activists prefer, just say hormones and surgeries. Just say the truth already. We’re talking about kids here.",1

so very sad.,0
"There won’t be any “history” books in our future, and if we do I’m pretty sure they won’t be truthful.",0
the daily wire needs to make a detransitioning movie to the same standard of what is a woman😊,1
These were actually VERY mild stories. I have read some horrible stories from Detransitioners that&#39;ll make you gag.,1
"Alright, now that this happened we can expect a change because remember, never prevent a tragedy always wait till it happens then do something",0
So sad for these kids. 😰,0
Why do you pretend you don&#39;t know the reason they allow this? it&#39;s because they want to reduce the population and the more gay people and the more people who chop up their private parts means the less people who will be breeding.,1

Women being refused hormones FOR menopause issues (which last sometimes up to 10+ years!)

FAMILY LIFE, &quot;American dream&quot; :own a home, have a family of your own and maintain them.<br>Idk wtf it is now",0
The doctors know NOTHING about hormone therapy. It’s still brand new. I’ve been doing steroids for a decade. Doctors know half of what I know. They don’t manage estrogen levels for these kids when they’re adding testosterone. It’s just laziness and financial motive on the professional end.,0
"Couple of things; while I acknowledge that there are mature teens, neither of these &quot;victims&quot; communicate like seventeen year old girls.<br>Further, if they are seventeen, who&#39;s to say they&#39;re not typical attention-seeking kids?

Yes, the ones pushing and promoting are absolutely the worst kind of human beings.",1
"A prediction: When in the future, these history books ask the question &#39;How could this have happened?&#39; none of them will blame cultural Marxism, post-modernism or any part of Left wing ideology. Keep up the good work Matt, but emphasise the role of the Left in this horror.",0

I can not imagine anything more horrifying than going through a medical procedure meant to &quot;fix&quot; you at the age of 14 only to discover it resulted in genital mutilation you have to live with your whole life. I guess I am opposed kind of like why I&#39;m against capital punishment; for fear of one innocent person being killed.<br>14 years old? Approved elective genital surgery? Hell, 8 years earlier, that kid &quot;identified&quot; as a firetruck or a princess. This is insane.",1

Any parent should know your children cannot make decisions like this...my GOD you live with them, what other minor decisions have they made and you just rolled your eyes or shook your head.",0
This made me cry. 😭 So much to pray for. 🙏,0
Politicians that make laws to punish parents that try to resist are among the worst scum here.,0
For those girls there are various feminization surgeries.  The problem is they are painful and expensive.,0
This is so sad.,0
Perhaps there are 4 major religions in this world not just 3.,0
Nothing tragic here..Only bad ppl making bad choices..Accept who you are..They want to detrans so they will cry after to be trans again.. They are insane..Assume your choice and stop playing the victims.. Anyone logic wont do things like that..So now go cry to your cult,1
I hate how anyone has to go through this. Especially if they never would have had gender dysphoria before. But the depression in this video is also what many trans teens feel.,0

There was once a time where lobotomy awarded a man with a Noble Peace Price. Keep that in mind when they&#39;re praising this evil procedure,0

Theese doctors are the same type of people as Mengele or Shiro Ishii. They will be judged the same in future generations.,0

Isn&#39;t it obvious that gender &quot;problem&quot; is just a tool ? One of the tools which are in use to remodel society. It&#39;s obvious for at least 2 decades that they need more submissive and feminine society that is easy to lead by emotions but not by facts.,1
This is terrible. I feel sorry for these people. They’ve been brainwashed and left with irreversible undesirable consequences. The ideologs who encouraged this are nowhere to be found. There’s no real help for these transitioners. The network is trying to block these individuals from telling their stories. How evasive.,0

I pray for this child and all the others like her. 💕",0

"I remember a story I heard a long time ago, more than a decade I would say. <br>It was about a man whom was abducted by aliens and he said he managed to communicate with them. <br>He said he asked them; &quot;What are you?&quot; and they supposedly replied along the lines of them being humans from the distant future and were unable to reproduce. <br>This was the reason for the reported abductions in our time, and why abductees often reported having something harvested or stolen from them. <br>Their reproductive cells such as eggs and the little swimmers. I thought little of it at the time, it was just a story and it was an interesting perspective, albeit slightly familiar from some sci-fi schow I&#39;ve seen at some point in life. <br><br>But this is no longer a fiction in my mind, I truly believe this to be a possibility now. Going down this road, along with the other things causing issues in reproducing; this story is a completely plausible idea in less than a few hundred years. Radiation and electromagnetism, bad food and GMO food with the epicyte gene which attacks reproductive cells (put into corn, why?), the promotion of transgenderism and all the other agendas going on right now which actively affects human reproduction, is far from a conspiracy theory at this point. <br>It&#39;s the agenda - Population control. Say it Matt, don&#39;t be afraid to speak real truth, to real power. Instead of just making fun of mentally ill teenagers, that&#39;s easy prey. <br>Go for the big whales here, expose the real agenda and not just the surface stuff.",1

Parents are supposed to protect their children from doing stupid shit like &quot;transitioning&quot; or thinking they can actually become the other gender. Has anyone considered the real possibility that if they were born the other gender they would still be dissatisfied with their current gender and would be prompted to transition? Just because you&#39;re a girl and not a boy doesn&#39;t mean you need to transition and just because you&#39;re a boy and not a girl doesn&#39;t mean you need to transition. I feel like no matter what you were born as you would want to be the other. Have you considered this? Just be who you are.,1

There is no baby that is born thinking &#39;this body is wrong.&#39; These &#39;clinics&#39; shouldn&#39;t groom kids but actually help them explore why the body they were born with is awesome. Instead doctors are allowing kids to change their bodies like swiping on Tinder.

Imagine a society made of a generation grown up with healthy, functional education that understands real self-acceptance. USE COMMON SENSE!",1

Instead of accepting the truth from real doctors and therapists, many of the individuals who prusued this lifestyle choice of theirs based on narcissism sought out &quot;doctors&quot; who would tell them what they wanted to hear.

This was followed by them getting to positions of power and influence to spread their message to young impressionable minds.",0

Pray for the young women highlighted here. God is the Redeemer. Pray He brings something good out of all this for these poor little girls who were abused in this way. They need some hope and purpose. This is heartbreaking! The lawsuits need to hit hard and fast until doctors fear the repercussions of this abuse more than they fear the mob and name-calling. And then states need to make the medical transition of minors illegal.  Texas has the right idea.,1
"People in the future will laugh at how in our times the only options given to people with gender dysphoria were bodily mutilation and taking hormones. <br>There must exist a substance which would cure gender dysphoria, or make it less intense.

Reminds me of the last century and the &quot;scientific&quot; use of methods to treat mental illness such as electric shocks and lobotomies.  Reason and evidence eventually won the day and these methods ceased being used.  I hope that reason will soon win the day with this issue as well.,0
"I saw this idea in another comment, and I want to second it. It’d be awesome if there was an advocacy group/organization that supported detransitioners, provided them with resources, and gave them a place to share their stories.<br><br>If people in this position feel more empowered, it might help them mentally — and it’ll help the average person for safer in labeling these surgeries as child abuse.",1
"The community is a giant echo chamber that baits people in by telling them transitioning will make everything better. If you dare step out of that chamber, it is met with immediate hospitality.<br><br>Cracking your “egg” as they call it is not brave.

It is unsustainable for society. <br>Thank you for all your work Matt!",1
It would be a good idea to make a support group. A lot of these kids feel alone for making a regrettable decision. Having a group could mean sharing the pain together and learning how to heal from it together.,0

Well, your home should be the best training zone for living regardless of stress. Not much philosophy is needed here, we messed it up. &quot;When I have a kid, I will allow everything&quot;.

Things fell apart a couple of times and had to be repaired, and now (s)he is 100 pounds overweight and practically catatonic with chronic fatigue and depression from issues that never got resolved by the surgery.

"I&#39;m a detransitioner and a conservative but I&#39;m getting really tired of Matt and the entirety of Con Inc&#39;s de/trans grift. When Matt especially feigns empathy after so much open mockery, which he slyly does so often, it&#39;s extremely grating to me. A large part of trans activism, ie especially &quot;trans actors for trans roles&quot; and the like is the rather understandable sentiment &quot;keep my name out of your mouth when I&#39;m not around&quot;, which watching Matt talk (on and on) about people like me I start to understand once again. I appreciate your levelheaded masculinity Matt, but that also contributes to the fatal lack of curiosity for and resulting understanding of the mindset of these vulnerable youths you claim to care about. I know you think you&#39;re trying to make a difference in The Marketplace of Ideas and &quot;boost our voices&quot; but I find these readings of intensely personal r/detrans posts for sycophantic clicks rather vulgar. Again, I am on the right as well, but We are not a part of your partisan war games. You remind me of the liberals who pryingly embarrassed me with overpraise (&quot;you&#39;re so brave&quot; and the like) with this detrans bandwagoning.

I cried for this poor child. This is wrong if a kid cannot consent to tattoo a child cannot consent to not being real therapy and have people manipulate them into being trans and also allowing them to consent to these permanent changes. Two things can be true it can be a positive things for adults to feel safe expressing themselves but this is disturbed and disgusting to push this on children you can have some thing that is overall good and it can be co-opted to do other bad things if this group can’t stand criticism they don’t deserve to have the standing that they do. They don’t seem compassionate at all unless it serves their narrative and the women who get impregnated in prisons the poor children who are not able to make decisions like this do not have an understanding of gender and to be forced to live as a boy or a girl based on simply being a feminine or masculine child is disgusting people are taking away expression.,1

I even went to the r/detrans subreddit and it&#39;s all the same. I feel as though I can confidently say that transgenderism is the most evil ideology in human history.,1
"It disgusts me how these people are abused on Twitter for detransitioning. Not the same, its like the people abused for losing weight, Adele for example.",0
"These kids are victims, the parents and doctors are evil.",0
Please make a documentary featuring detransitioners.,0
Your closing statements are so true,0
"This is so sad... these poor, lost, broken people, being manipulated when they&#39;re at their lowest and in the most need of guidance. <br><br>Some &quot;professionals&quot; these doctors and therapists are... they don&#39;t even care about these people, they just want to play around with &quot;sCiEnCeS&quot;",0
"Poor kids, their parents should burn for this, their kids want to kill themselves. They are monsters for not helping their kids, instead they give them drugs let money grubbing doctors mutilate them with surgery. These things are permanent and immature minds change with the wind and manipulation of adults with agendas.",0
I&#39;m so so lucky I had a good mother to guide me through that.,0
Going to be A LOT of these moving forward.,0
"This is the saddest thing I&#39;ve heard in a long time. The only way we will be able to put an end to this thing is if the people who were so severely abused and ruined by these people start suing them until there is nothing left of this horrific business. It doesn&#39;t even have to be the majority. If enough people sue these monsters into the ground, nobody will dare do this to any more people for fear of being sued for everything they have.<br><br>It&#39;s just so sad, because it preys on girls when they are at their most emotionally vulnerable. I don&#39;t blame these girls for not wanting to be a girl. I wouldn&#39;t want to be a girl while going through puberty either, it sounds AWFUL. But this is worse than awful, it&#39;s hell. That, and I&#39;m convinced that it&#39;s a social contagion. Many of these people only want to transition because they see people doing it on TikTok, and girls are very susceptible to emotions that make them want to feel like they are part of a social group. They are more sensitive to negative emotions than men, and they will do anything to gain a feeling of one-ness with others. They are not in a position to make a rational decision, they are too emotionally volatile and confused at this stage of their life. When their hormones stop raging and their emotions calm down a bit as they reach adulthood, they realize how bad of an idea it is.<br><br>I want to know how we got to this stage. Why the hell does anyone think it&#39;s a good idea to so recklessly tamper with human biology at the most important developmental stage of their life? Hormones are powerful. These people have played God and thought they could shape a human being however they saw fit and not see any consequences. Well, here are the consequences. I can only hope that by the time I have kids, this practice is destroyed. And I pray for those who are victims of this. They have been thrust into a hell that is going to be very hard to escape. We need as many people as possible working to mitigate the damage as soon as possible. They need to form support groups, and they need to be given a place where they can heal their minds and souls as much as possible. I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s mostly too late for their bodies, I imagine, but if they realize their mistake soon enough, maybe it wouldn&#39;t be impossible to help them.",1
The Devil’s agenda is what the left is all about.,0
i can&#39;t believe none of these poor kids have shot up those experts at those clinics....wouldn&#39;t blame them,0
"Today I watched Blaire White&#39;s podcast with Ritchie, a detransitioner. I cried listing to his story..........so very sad and tragic.",0
Hard to blame the parents when in some cases they dont have a say.  Systems are in place to hide things from them or even  rip the descision out of the parents hands.,0
If we don&#39;t do something to stop this now in 20 years all these young adults are going to be walking around depressed confused lost because they can&#39;t be who they want to be because they&#39;ve been butchered or chemically changed,0
Their stories are being supressed by big tech.  We need to make sure their voices are heard!,0
How did these demons get unleashed on us. It seems as though we finally went over the cliff.,0
Excellent! I didn&#39;t know you&#39;re doing detransition stories. You should compile them in a easy access section on DW app if you and your team haven&#39;t already. That way it&#39;s easy to throw the stories in peoples faces when they say no one is detransitioning. You do great work man.,0
But all these doctors have an agenda to make money they don&#39;t care and they&#39;re all on the left these obviously aren&#39;t ethical doctors conservative doctors cuz it would have never happened,0
Because the therapist was a liberal with non-conservative views when you pick a therapist you make sure you know who they are next time,0
Well we know this is gonna happen it&#39;s common sense,0
"Those poor girls.. I didn’t even know you could transition at 14, how disgusting",1
"This is exactly what I was talking about, these poor children are being mentally abused and not thoroughly vetted for treatments! I was 35 and had lived a full life of memories before committing to my transition, these poor kids aren&#39;t given a choice! It&#39;s purely disgusting and I commend you Matt for standing up for the kids, this crusade of yours is an honorable one and you have gained an ally! God Bless you!🙏😌",0
Evil parents destroy their children as they virtue posture their wokeness by transitioning their children.,1
Detransitioners is a mighty long word. It&#39;s got 3 more letters than Mockingbird.,0
These stories were heart breaking to hear.,0
Every dr that&#39;s performed &quot;gender affirming care&quot; on minors needs to be locked up. If there was a surgery involved the dr should get the chair,1
"I think this is a very good time to reflect on how we should treat people that continue to identity as trans.<br><br>Yes, if they’re a full on advocate shoving it down everyone’s throat, there’s a lot that they deserve coming to them.<br>But many transsexuals are just normal people who are struggling greatly with their identity and mental health, and have been indoctrinated into thinking that they can transition and it eoll fix their problems. <br>When the day comes that we can have conversations saying that we want to help these people, but dont think that ‘transitioning’ is the right answer, we will make significant progress as a nation and as humans.",1
one of the saddest things I&#39;ve ever heard,0
Eugenics experiments.. Mengela would be proud,0
Let&#39;s hope these young adults get the help they need to get through this,0
"To ruin lives, to depopulate, to be wealthy is the aim  - I wish i could hug those young people who stepped forward !!",0
"Munchausen by proxy. And greedy, greedy, doctors.",0
Doctors: It’s just good business pay to ruin your body then charge you again to try and “fix”,0
"Great video, thanks 👍",0
"Unfortunately, parents often no longer get a say 😞",0
"Dare to say a discouraging word about the Trans thing and you&#39;ll be accused to &quot;harming people.&quot; it&#39;s good that some kids who were REALLY harmed by this madness, are speaking up!! .When you allow 13 and 14 year old children to make life altering decisions because of peer pressure (real or imagined) or because it&#39;d it&#39;s cool, it certainly IS madness!,   Kudos to Matt Walsh for staying on point with this!",1
"Somebody please help us conservative therapists who are hogtied in our profession to even help these kids question their transness. There’s so much legislation and pressure from our liberal professional leadership and the liberal states that we live in to affirm these children that I’ve had to take off of my website that I help with questioning sexuality because I am not trying to get arrested for not affirming their transness. I was trained to not affirm someone’s mental illness but to help them get to the bottom of it and learn to live in the body that they have. Other therapists will just not come forward because we are terrified that we will lose our license, that we will be arrested, that we’ll be sued,  and we know that if we are shut down, what hope at all do these kids have for any kind of professional to use known mental health practices to help them. I really want to help children and adults who want to Detransition but we need lawmakers and lawyers and celebrity figures to get behind us because we can’t do this on our own. We will be crushed. We have seen others get crushed and we are terrified that will happen to us. Not all of us can just rush out and throw our career aside to take this Juggernaut on. We have families we have to support we have other community members that require our help. We need someone like Matt Walsh to step forward and help us. Maybe Jordan Peterson could help us. Somebody please this is our cry for help as true therapists.   I pray every single day that God will show me someway or that will inspire others to help us. I feel like I’m just kind of hiding out until that happens so that I can leap forward with my arms open professionally and say that I am able to help detransitioners. If I can’t help my own niece who transitioned into a man maybe I could help others.",1
"Just like r/trump, prepare for this r/detrans to be banned over nonspecific hate",0
I wish more people were brave enough to talk about this stuff. It is truly terrible,0
Crazy that they would actually think children can make life decisions like this. They still got to get reminded when to take a bath but you allow them to change gender? 🤦🏿‍♂️,1
like a MEME once said if you are worried about what pronouns people call you are the most privileged.,1
We’re fighting to help you all from this but you call us bigots and racists and take away our voices. It comes from mercy,0
We are supposed to protect children 🥺,0
I got a Gay Monkey Pox STD commercial before watching this video.,0
This story will not be in the history books.  The left filters out anything &amp; everything that makes them look bad.  That&#39;s why the kids are taught almost nothing in history class.,0
"If you go all the way with it, Transgendering is a form of Suicide.",1
"Back 2016, if one watched TV, one might have thought that the problems of transgender people where the most important in the world.  I think alot of people voted for Trump because they thought he was going to put a stop to trans surgery.",1
"wow,, sad sad",0
"It all boils down to..Pervert and Non pervert. When you take away all these rediculous stupid word games its a bunch of degerates and phycotic misfits encouraged by the democrats agenda to weaken the human spirit. My cure for this nonsense would be that evertime one of these kooks make a video someone ought to take a Razor strap to the back of there legs for a few minutes or so, that,ll take the sas out of them. A forced 6 month Bible study wouldnt hurt either....",1
These stories horrify me and my heart goes out to the victims. I hope you find your way back to true womanhood,0
"Hopefully, you keep up the good fight and more and more people join. The expose you did may save lives in the long run.",0
Can they at least wait until these children are old enough to understand basic biological gender?  Like the difference between born males and females?  Also aren&#39;t cupiosexuals and cupioromantics - people who need a long-term emotional connection before feeling sexual or romantic attraction- just what used to be called a LOT of NORMAL PEOPLE?,1
I am a therapist in California and I openly welcome detransitioners who need support.  These people deserve so much love and support from real therapists who don’t push people into adhering to social contagions.,0
"&#39;&#39; How did this happen? &quot;<br><br>I think part of the answer is - slowly.<br><br>These people take one step at a time, and force their detractors to take one step back at a time too",0
Evil is the only word for those pushing this mental illness on children. Horrible torturous way to slowly kill them.,0
What Pharma corporations are supporting the trans movement?,0
"I&#39;m glad to see you&#39;re finally giving time to detransitioners. Please don&#39;t forget about the male to female to males. They need to be encouraged to tell their stories. As far as the history books go, aren&#39;t you forgetting about demon Trump? The books will focus on<br> T and T. <br> Trump and Trans, <br>both complete insanity. If you continue to drink the Trump aid, you will be on the wrong side of that. He is equally as monstrous.",1
Wow this is incredible reporting. Voice of the voiceless.,0
"Oh, God. It&#39;s so sad",0
It starts with the doctors. Start putting these doctors on blast. They are the problem. Let’s remove them from the planet.,0
"I really like watching Blair Whites interviews of detransitioners, because she is a transgender woman herself and STILL shows humanity and empathy for these children who were preyed upon.",0
"We need to be changing laws so these monsters can finally be locked up for this. Something needs to break the delusion and get it through to people that they are literally sterilizing, drugging, and mutilating children, the hell we can&#39;t legally put them in a prison cell! There&#39;s no reason why we shouldn&#39;t be allowed to do so, and the fact that there&#39;s laws protecting these freaks shows how screwed up our &quot;leaders&quot; are. A swift and dramatic change needs to happen, and fast.",0
"Mr. Walsh, do you have a real post office mailing address I can send a letter to of something that happened to one kin. I don&#39;t like email.",0
The comparison I find most apt for this moment is the so-called doctors who went around throughout much of the 20th century lobotomizing depressed people and schizophrenics.,0

"Hello my name is Matt from New Jersey, I don’t give a fuck about my pronouns and I certainly don’t give a fuck about yours.",1
Matt is right .  Chldren have never ever been in such peril before from  monstrous adults who should be caring for them and looking out for thier wellbeing .,0

These are heartbreaking. These therapists need to be prosecuted and jailed.,0
These people need some psychological counseling and medication.....they are freaking psychotic....So....men are using up gyn appointments that women need because they need to include other people in their fantasy world. This is so annoying.,1

"I want more people to understand where Matt Walsh is coming from. He is a father. He has young children. He cares about the good of the world. All people who oppose him can only see a warped perception of his intentions. <br>Please, if you can&#39;t hear what Matt is trying to tell the world, at LEAST please hear the children who are saying the same things as him.",0

"I was SO lucky to be born when I was and that my parents had a brain. I 100% would have identified as one of these girls in my youth.

I frequently expressed my desire to be a boy and it lasted until my late teens.<br><br>Eventually and somewhat naturally, I learned to accept and love myself as a girl. I also gained the confidence to like what I like and say no to things that I don&#39;t. Back then, I felt pressured to look and be a certain way and that&#39;s why I believed I had to physically change in order to escape those societal expectations. But now I know that I don&#39;t have to conform to a certain identity to enjoy those things. I am a woman nonetheless and I&#39;m very happy with who I am today.",0

It’s not perfect, but there’s still a lot you can do.  Some people get into car crashes and have burns and all types of horrible things happen to them. But, there’s still a life worth living even after the devastation.  Your life is meaningful and God loves you.",0

I think that taxpayers should have to foot the entire medical bill for &#39;gender affirming transition surgery&#39;.  I also thing tax payers should have to pay for the &#39;detransition surgery&#39; as well when the person changes their minds later. Best advice would be to store the bits you had cut off in your freezer. You might need them later.,1

I was actually banned from the Askreddit subreddit recently. The reason? There was a thread asking what practice will be looked back on in a hundred years the way we look back on lobotomies today. I said the removal of tits/dicks from healthy children and BOOM! Instantly banned forever...🤦‍♂ I hope the people currently behind this movement feel REALLY bad in a few years time.

The transgender community on reddit has their own detransition subreddit called &quot;actual_detrans&quot;. They give detransitioners this space to discuss their story under their watchful eye. Since they can&#39;t stand to have any detransitoners bashing them in a space they do not control.,1

I&#39;m waiting for this plague to cease or lessen . It is easier to connect when you find common grounds with people not create more titles and boundaries to separate yourself . At the end of the day, let&#39;s just hope none of this is pushed on future generations ( let people raise their own children and don&#39;t force ideology on them)  and allow people to respectfully decline you forcing your ideology on them . There was a young person who said thst if you don&#39;t refer to them by their pronouns you will not refer to the person at all . Childish . Give someone your name and they can use that . It&#39;s easy . Tell me your name is Bill and I&#39;ll call you Bill. Whether we agree with each other or not...you are now..Bill.",1
I will never understand why people like Matt think that just because a small amount of people detransition that must mean all trans people are invalid and faking or lying or whatever bullshit. The percentage of people who do detransition is so small and even within that small percentage the more common reasons of detransitioning are things like cost or lack of support from family. The amount of people who detransition due to regret or not being trans is very small. You shouldn&#39;t take that small group and use it to judge and hate actual trans people.,0
I think they may be worse than the average Nazi.,0

Thank God, I already had my mind made about my identity, and I already understood and followed my faith (as a Christian), or else, I could have been influenced by them.<br> The first girl&#39;s case is bad, and I can say this from experience.

She still can get a female voice by submitting herself to the thyroplasty type IV surgery, but IT WON&#39;T BE THE SAME AS WHAT SHE HAD. Even though the surgery can help with the voice, it will never be the same due to the influence of testosterone during her puberty, and I&#39;m sad for her since I can still bet on the surgery to help me get my natural voice, but she can&#39;t. Her voice will never return to what it was in the past.",1
I think a lot of these girls would benefit from a breast reduction. A lot of times girls who developed way too early with very large chests are very self conscious. So from a DDD to B could make them happy not these horrific mutilations.,0

"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxsgfVmrMk&amp;t=12m30s"">12:30</a> so you’re expecting 240 million Americans to change the way they talk by referring to a person in a plural way which further more confuses the entire conversation because…. Your feelings are hurt?? Am I getting that right? You want the entire American population to reverse everything that they were taught at school since kindergarten by talking like this: “oh yea they helped me” “I can’t remember if it was them” when the conversation is about ONE person. Do you not see how confusing that can be? The first question anyone will ask is wait which people are you talking about. Then you have to sit there and explain that you’re referring to that person as they them. Any normal human with a brain will not be able to get over the sheer stupidity of that attempt to pluralize a person. Couldn’t you people come up with a different word that hasn’t been used in a way for thousands of years? Heck you could’ve used alien, or even made up a word fico for male and fica for woman and even that would’ve been ok. But you expect me to change the way I was taught English because you’re wearing earrings? Furthermore, in your example you don’t even explain to the person you are talking to. You just correct that person by simply saying “they” or “them” as if they will pick up their “mistake”. In conclusion you can’t expect for every person to have the same mindset as you. I’m very knowledgeable in football. But when someone saids “the guy with the ball ran and went to the other end of the field”, I’m not going to get angry and say THE RUNNING BACK!! And shake my shirt at them that as a picture of a running back on it as if that knowledge should be common sense. That’s the problem what your common sense is delusional while another person’s common sense is conclusional.",1

"It breaks my heart hearing about these individuals realizing that they made a mistake transitioning and the severe depression it has been causing them to the point where they think ending their life is an option. This is exactly why gender affirming clinics should be illegal because they are not looking out for the best interests of those questioning themselves and seeking help. Discovering and questioning your own identity is a natural part of life. If people are pushing you to surgery as a way to discover your true identity, then they don&#39;t have your best interest in mind.",1

"WHERE ARE THE PARENTS???!!! This is heartbreaking, but these are CHILDREN! I can not wrap my mind around a parent who would allow their child&#39;s body to be mutilated in this way. My daughter wanted a tattoo and body piercings. I told her that while she was my responsibility she would not alter her body. Once she became an adult, if it was something she still wished to do then I would happily support her. But I guarantee you that if THIS is what she&#39;d been asking for, I&#39;d have scoured the continent for ANY non-woke mental health professional that would treat the underlying psychological issue driving such a request.

The main stream media needs to publish these stories, only then will supporters actually believe that the stories are true.",1

"Matt i was with you until you began calling those who push the trans agenda evil and much more. These people are confused, as we all are when it comes to this stuff, and they&#39;re leading with their compassion attribute maxed out. It&#39;s a relatively new problem that we&#39;re trying to figure out as a society and the people who think that transitioning is the solution aren&#39;t de-facto evil because of the horrors of the stories you read. Stories which nearly brought me to tears, by the way. I cannot imagine the pain these people are in. For the pro-transitioners, they, misguidedly, truly think the ends justify the means, and that the &#39;ends&#39; are desirable as they see them through heavily rose tinted glasses. They believe they&#39;re doing the right thing. I can list many reasons why calling these people evil is un/counterproductive, but it&#39;s the type of rhetoric that only makes people dig their heels in on both sides. But thank you for covering these stories. We need honest discussion and all information and possible outcomes to be told in full before these disaffected people make such a massive, consequential, and irreversible decision. And before you started the name-calling, i was just thinking to myself that this might be a good video to refer to a friend who may think differently about this than i do",0

The reason this has happened and I truly believe in my heart is that the people pushing this and doing this to these kids are pedophiles! It&#39;s sad because more people are going to come out hurting because of this transition that these pedophiles keep pushing on kids. This needs to end before more kids are going to be hurt. And the one mistake they did was once you messed with the kids you unite every race together to fight against that. I&#39;m Puerto Rican of sick to my stomach knowing that these pedophiles are destroying our kids our future.

There is a Terrible sense of narcissist behavior that seems to dictate this way of thinking I feel like I live in a way different world.

"I swear to god, some of these are valid like saying I’m gay, I’m Lesbian, I’m bisexual, or I go by they/them.  But those are as far as I go.  Allllll the rest of these “Neo Genders”, and especially the “Neopronouns” are stupid AF and are literally people just trying to be “Different” from the rest of their community.  Like I’m 100000% certain that 99.9% of these people are just saying this shit for attention.  They come up with the terms “Neopronouns” to stand out, because LITERALLY nothing about them is interesting, so they decide to make their “Gender” their WHOLE FUCKING IDENTITY, and if you call them out for how stupid a “Neopronoun” like fucking clown and clown self are (yes,some on TikTok ACTUALLY wants to be called fucking CLOWNSELF), they go Batshit crazy and fucking cancel you and call you fucking homophobic and shit.  There are two genders,  Male and Female, THATS IT.  If you don’t think any of them apply to you, for whatever reason, use They/Them, but that’s it.  There is literally no convincing reason why you need to go by Thin/Thiney, Zey/Zem, Dem/Demy,  Nipo, Nipa, or use fucking “Demon pronouns.”<br>If you have a penis you’re a boy, and if you don’t feel like a boy, then fine, that means your a girly boy, nothing wrong with that.  However you don’t need to fucking change your GOD DAMN DNA, and Biological structure, to become a girl.  Same thing goes with women.  This is what happens to a generation that was raised on the internet.

They were 4 and 6 years old and they already had a phone.  These fuckers we’re entitled AF, but my moms a teacher and actually fixed them.

"It&#39;s only recently that I came across your channel and saw you break down the queer nuances of the Dead Poets Society. I must tell you, as a queer person who seems to incessantly scan for homosexual subtext, it was immensely liberating to find - and here comes the phrase - that I&#39;m not alone. I adore the fact that you provide a socio-philosophical basis for your content because it helps me reframe queerness as something that doesn&#39;t only concern my own (individual) self-perception, but which is so packed with social influence. I can&#39;t thank you enough for the distinction made between queer integration into heteronormative social order vs. the restructuring and reshaping of the social order - it gives so much perspective. Sociology articulates the queer condition so succintly and beautifully, doesn&#39;t it? Again, I can&#39;t thank you enough, for both the content you produce and its inspiring logistics and conclusions :)",0
"Another comment about how this applies in the asexual and aromantic communities: I&#39;ve seen people asking stuff like &quot;what do aces/aros wear?&quot; since other queer communities have their own styles (eg. bi ppl and doc martens). I always felt that it was kind of inherently exclusionary to suggest that styles of dress correspond to different sexual orientations (especially is they don&#39;t develop organically irl), since not everyone is going to like those styles, but I hadn&#39;t thought about the classist angle. This was a great eye-opening marxist queer video as always.",0

"So... I think this video is really wierd. I dont think is its necessarily bad though. I think so because lots of parts of this video confused me (like pretty much the first 8min) or what i think was attempted humor (this is a wierd thing to criticize because jokes are inherently at subjective) didnt land at all with me even though (i think) i recognized the jokes themselves and how they were ment to work. From the top of my head id say this video feels like it was made for an audiance/ community im just not part of and i dont know if this was delibreately done (for example as some sort of artistic choice) or if this might be a problem with the script. <br>Especially at the beginning i thought there was a strong lack of framing/explanation as for what is said. (like in the beginning i was confused to what even means gay music? Like music only gay people listen to? Or from gay people? Or music used in reference to pro LGBTQ movements? or just stereotypically gay? depending on the awnser to this question, id even have a few following questiions) And yes some of the things that confused me were later addresed and explained in the video but if i have to wonder (for 20min in the most extreme part of this) what was even meant in the introduction, the content in between (first mention and explanation through context) suffers from it. After watching the whole video im sadly not entirely sure what im supposed to take away from it and i think a lot of the video sounded like nonsense gibberish which is really sad because i can absolutely see a intelligent young guy who obvioulsly put a lot of work into this. All it took was a better structure/ framework/mabye even a little more explanation the video/script better to be more convincing. Well either this or i actually dont fit the audience this video was meant for. Also meaning id lack in basic knowledge of the topic. Which again would be sad because i think in there actually is a very interresting topic anyone could want to learn about (very subjective). (I recognize there is nothing wrong with putting out a video generally only ment for people who already have some basic knowledge of the topic. Pretty much all topics get very complex at a point.)<br>I also dont like clarifying something by putting a text on the screen for not even a second to read. (in the beginning there once were only 5 frames of time to read! WTF man? do you want me to not watch the video or should i rater try to find the right frame to pause on and get annoyed? Like seriously why is the only &quot;context&quot; that was actually readable the 72 times boring written over the screen that didnt even say something other then please laugh) Please at least let the conText stay a few seconds on screen.<br>Apart from that some statements are wierdly framed or debatable id say. However these dont really are a big problem as they generally werent really the focus of the argument but merely means to transition and a slight misrepresentation of some little facts shouldnt hurt anyone too much.",0

One more datapoint for you that is technically useless (or is it?)<br>I <b>could</b> say that I am partularly leaning towards &quot;video game music&quot; and &quot;movie/series soundtracks&quot;, but since those are technically just subsets of &quot;world music&quot;, &quot;electronic music&quot; and &quot;classical music&quot; depending on the individual album itself, I still cannot find any leaning towards any specific genre.<br>Also, I don&#39;t like the new contemporary pop music, so I wouldn&#39;t even like to listen to the &quot;Deserved&quot; playlist.<br>Not to mention the fact that I don&#39;t even use spotify. (probably because I am too ancient (90&#39;s kid) and stick to CD-rips and downloaded mp3&#39;s)<br>Also, I do guess another influence would be from which country or even just what continent someone is from, because there&#39;s specific cultural practices that don&#39;t necessarily stick to one&#39;s &quot;race&quot; (as a German native speaker it&#39;s really weird using that word, even in English) or ethnic group, but also to one&#39;s physical living space.",0
"I um, so wtf is going on, 80 yrs ago people were fighting for freedom against a racist fascist dictator killing and persecuting them for there beliefs.

I don&#39;t hate gay people, I just hate people who don&#39;t understand what other people go through on a daily basis.",1

"So how does Spotify manufacture Gay culture?<br>I watched the entire video and can&#39;t tell; you went on an entire rant about how gay culture came to be in general and how Spotify has curators but none of it answered the question you proposed in the title of the video. The playlist isn&#39;t even in the pride section of Spotify you displayed in the video, it was just some other playlist in that section that linked to it as &quot;if you like this you might like this as well, lol&quot;.

"As a straight guy, I&#39;ve always wondered why there is music specifically associated with LGBTQ+ people I mean does sexuality really give you an ascribed music taste?

Kinda like a dude claiming to be transgender then raping girl in bathroom! Told my wife mark my word that it would happen 4 years ago I hate being right! I don&#39;t care who love who just not in public stop forcing others to use pronouns! Its retarded. Live your life stop bitching I am married Bi sexual male who cares! Why is it so import for everyone to be accepted by others when they can not accept the fact that they where born with having female or male parts get over them selves grow up take responsibility! Society is only going to take so much of this nonsense! I agree let people be what there going to be but don&#39;t complain about because your in love with a toaster! I am serious! Go be in love with you toaster but do not tell me to check my pronouns. Or you will find yourself in a situation! It extremely rude to tell someone what to think or say!

"The asexuals not having any correlation is accurate. As a nonbinary aroace my Spotify Assigned Genre™ last year i think was vocaloid, midwest emo, indie pop, and weirdcore.

the real question is why the back of a cvs feels cis-het,0
So everybody has to respect their pronouns? Well doesn&#39;t that work both ways? If everyone has to respect their pronouns then they in turn have to respect everyone else&#39;s opinions and views on how they perceive everyone else&#39;s gender. If your male biologically I&#39;m going to call you a guy. If you are a female I&#39;m going to call you a girl. Plain and simple. This trend is getting old. If we never had social media this whole gender dysphoria crap never would have came to be.,1

"Being a kid was weird in that you don&#39;t have the money to consume (so not enjoying material cultural signals), but you have the affordability? to... enjoy free-ish cultural things? like music? that is curated by more well-off people? Or not. idk.<br><br>For me being gay (and the other LGBTQ+ stuff) just limits what I can listen to, by making certain songs more cringe, certain lyrics hated, and certain artists self-banned. No supporting homophobes. Not too much heterosexual love. Hatred of &quot;the one&quot; narrative and focus on marriage. Disgust towards gay bait. Maybe the positive effects (making me like certain music more) would be related to needing of empowerment, empathy with some of women&#39;s struggle, and celebration of &quot;this speaks only to the gays&quot; or &quot;gay struggles&quot; titles.<br><br>Conversations about what being gay when there&#39;s nothing inherently gay in it, seems very much like creating a culture that has an in and out group, and I really don&#39;t like that. That&#39;s like saying this is the way to be gay, other things are wrong. Which, not the best message. Not sure why gay people would do it, but I guess we do live in a Capitalist society. Why form a community based on bad practices when we can just form it based on shared struggles and joys you know? Joys that do not exclude people with shared struggles who feel at home with the same label as you. 🤞",0

"Sixteen years old me had a lot of trouble with that.

I do liked some lady Gaga songs and grew up with my sister blasting Britney Spears but it wasn’t enough. <br><br>The funny part is that, a few months ago, I realized that I’m more bi than gay and some aspect of my music taste fit with the bi stereotypes… even if the majority of the songs that I like are listened by cis straight men (underground rap, metals being at the top of my most listened genre)",0

"I haven&#39;t finished but if I&#39;ll probably forget if I don&#39;t comment now, I think there&#39;s a missing angle here. The AIDs crisis of the 80s had a dramatic impact on which side of the coin was leading the national movements. Act Up and associated movements that were on the left and had a lot of grass roots, lower income power behind them, numbers of invested individuals rather than numbers in the bank. The rich white gay men who survived due to easier access to medicine or lessened exposure due to restricted circles of exposure and an inclination to only screw their metaphorical cousins in the community, once these men took over the leadership positions and pushed out those remaining lower income originating or left leaning voices we end up with people like Mayor Pete Buttigieg, the extremely wealthy ultra capitalists who use their sexuality without being part of it&#39;s community.",0

"Interesting material and something I&#39;ve been thinking about, but from a different perspective.<br>I am a cis monogamous heterosexual, but my whole life have been drawn more into the transgressive and subversive parts of the queer culture (and I do enjoy &quot;energetic dance pop&quot;, but it&#39;s not my no1 thing). As a teenager, I grew up mostly listening to punkrock and hanging around squats in Eastern Europe, but in my 20s I changed my tastes and started attending queer parties and clubs associated with all kinds of aspects of underground culture and music (like in the style of Posession techno or for a more mainstream example - Berghain style underground clubs and parties).<br>I always enjoyed people there, the overall vibe, freshness and originality, breaking of the social norms, and always felt welcome - never as an intruder/appropriator of the culture. Even some of my daily clothing or piercing is considered by some of my friends &quot;queer&quot;. Much later in my life I moved to the US and unsurprisingly, I enjoyed a lot living in Castro in SF, and now in NYC in Bushwick.<br><br>So in this way, some aspects of the social construct of queerness have definitely gone beyond sexuality and orientation, but it&#39;s not just commodified, happy upbeat pop music. I&#39;m not a sociologist and not equipped to analyze it properly, but it seems to me that there is this aspect of queer culture that I&#39;ve been drawn to is almost the opposite of the consumerist affluent &quot;gayness&quot; - breaking of some social norms (again - especially in Eastern Europe where I grew up, where LGBT people still don&#39;t enjoy many most basic rights it is breaking many norms and puts LGBT folks as a target of hate) comes with broader breaking of other norms which makes it fresh, interesting, and original. &quot;Queer clubs are the place where the new culture happens&quot; could be said about the 70s NYC disco scene, 80s Detroit techno scene, or today various parties in Berlin, NYC, Paris, but also my home town of Warsaw.<br><br>Maybe I am a cultural intruder? How much of attempted allyship and sharing experiences becomes appropriation? <br>Would love to hear your thoughts about it.",0

I only have one gay friend who likes very &#39;gay&#39; music. <br><br>I like the &#39;gay&#39; music, and the rock, and the punk, and the hiphop, and the pop. Trying to analyse what that makes me I think I might be... into all music.",0
"shout out to LGBTQIA+ folks with obscure music tastes. Most of what I listen to falls under &quot;Moody Dnb, Hyperpop, Jungle and Breakcore&quot; with Metal, Punk, and Hip-hop sprinkled in here and there.",0
Is it weird if I&#39;ve never labelled music as straight/gay or even thought about doing so? The only time I&#39;d ever say a song could be one or the other is if the lyrics themselves were about a straight or gay couple.,0
WE ONLY HAVE 2 GENDERS:<br>mfs look like some weirdo punks,1

Last week my nephew’s school sent a permission slip for a pronoun gender education presentation and my nephew’s parents quickly wrote No and nephew won’t attend it…and my sister now told me that all of my nephew’s classmate’s parents also won’t have their kids won’t be attending 😂😂😂so basically all of the 5th grade class students didn’t get permission to attend and the school had to cancel the presentation 😂,1
"I personally think its the gay EQ, gay reverb, gay compressors and gay mastering techniques used by the artists.",0
"thank you for making this video, it’s incredibly interesting!",0
Next time do research with the playlist that was really created by a queer person.,0

"None of this music is gay enough for me, I&#39;m going to go listen to &quot;Menergy&quot; by Patrick Cowley.",0
"Fascinating video. I don&#39;t know how it factors in, but I know a part of my tastes results from not growing feeling like I was a part of the queer community. I didn&#39;t even know what transgender was until my 20s. By the time I came out I was 32, so even though I&#39;m a gay man I have 3 decades of being treated like a straight woman that was kind of gender nonconforming.<br><br>Most of the time when someone says that X is gay, I usually don&#39;t agree. I recognize something to be queer-coded, but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s actually queer. A lisp isn&#39;t queer. It&#39;s just one form of coding.",0

"i made a playlist on spotify and gave it a gay pun that i found funny at about 2am for a name and then didn&#39;t add any songs to it. it&#39;s really funny seeing what songs spotify recommends. at first it was mostly girl in red, dodie, etc. today it was dodie, janelle monáe, king princess, good good sure… and then girls / girls / boys by panic, which was just offensive lol",0
"&quot;as an ambiguously brown person&quot; - reminds me of a conversation me and my brother had.<br>yeah sure my brother and I are genetically &quot;kinda brown&quot; and we eat some pretty ethic food, but were both raised in upper middle class New England.<br>the moment you ask me about halla food or to speak Urdu we get kinda glassy eyed and end up feelin&#39; pretty basic.<br><br>not throwin&#39; shade at you or anythin&#39; just remembering",0
"This was surprisingly funny 😁, I don&#39;t think I was prepared for all the jokes. I love it! Nice work",0
"This was super interesting! Having grown up in the midwest, despite myself being bi and existing comfortably within the gayosphere, it is a world that is foreign to me, as its one I have only been able to join in adulthood.

"For the asexuals, if I were to hazard a guess, there aren’t many songs in any genre that are “relatable”, given that many songs have sexual undertones. So there’s a lot of genre bouncing.<br><br>Or maybe it would be better analyzed by romantic attraction than sexual. (Though I assume there would be similar results for aromantics)",0
"I think one thing you missed in the cultural signifiers sections, where you mentioned iced coffee and corduroy was the aspect of doing things intentionally outside of the norm in one&#39;s aesthetic. Like AFAB people drawing on a mustache or shaving their heads, or AMAB people wearing high femme makeup. Yes, these things do cost money, but arguably you can get a buzz cut and a few basic makeup items for pretty cheap, so do they fall into the same consumerist category? There seems to be a spectrum.",0
"None of these sexualities even exist, logically speaking. These people are just taking pride in what they aren&#39;t; straight, sane, and healthy.",1
"The point about queer cultural signifiers being restricted to the class of people who can afford them is well taken. Reminds me of my own hesitancy to come out as non-binary due to the financial strain of buying enough cultural signifiers to create what would be socially recognized as non-binary. Now that I have more disposable income, I&#39;m actually able to create an aesthetic with fashion and makeup that I feel more fully represents myself, and has the lovely side-effect of causing strangers to default to they/them pronouns without me asking.<br>I love that I&#39;m actually able to afford to create this aesthetic that I feel is more fully me. It&#39;s quite interesting to consider the cultural implications of the individualist and consumerist expression of queerness vs. the collective power expression of queerness.",0
"This is very well researched, well put together, and entertaining. Very excited to see what you continue to produce!",0
"These results are fascinating (finding a negative correlation for queer people liking with the music styles in Deserved), but one thing you may be missing is the specific artists and songs. Perhaps Madonna and Lady Gaga have special qualities other than &quot;happy dance music&quot; that are appealing to gays.",0
Wow this is very good. I&#39;m really excited to see the way you&#39;ve evolved as a creator.,0
"My favorite quote: &quot; Spotify is a middleman... or a &quot;middleperson,&quot; if you find the woke mob kinda hot.&quot;",0

"I really like the subtle humor that you sprinkle through the video, it generally helps the point and isn&#39;t as distracting as the overly dramatic skits that many other youtubers seem to rely on (you know who I&#39;m talking about).   I am a late transitioning trans woman and found music to be a really big part of discovering myself.   Rather than rely on playlists, I found artists who were openly queer and for a time listened to nothing but that.    Queer people can be found in lots of genres, even more obscure ones like doom metal (Vile Creature, Bodyvoid) or steampunk (Steam Powered Giraffe).   But if I was looking for songs specifically about queer (and specifically trans)  things, Spotify quickly categorized my &quot;daily mix&quot; into sad queer and angry queer and honestly not a lot else.   I also noticed that there were some songs that always got pushed (&quot;They, Them, Theirs&quot; by the Worriers, for example, always seemed to be in the list) while other bands barely get in the mixes (We Are the Union, an awesome ska band).",0

It is not trans exclusive, it is male exclusive. Women who identify as men are included in radical feminism. ET also claims that he made derogatory comments about gender...no, he didn&#39;t.

"Great video! If I have one criticism though, it&#39;s that this video seems to focus on queerness as sexuality (especially in the survey as it did not ask any questions about transness), and while this video is studying a type of music I typically associate with cis gay men, the exclusion of transness as a factor does erase a large part of the community that while foundational is often overlooked.",0

"This is just a suggestion but I think that it might be helpful to add a conclusion of your thoughts/opinion/finding at the end of your videos along with the thought pieces you leave behind for your audience to think about because, I think I got the message of this video: that queer culture as we understand it is defined by the taste of the middle and upper class, because, queerness, having no physical markers, is expressed through consumer purchases, and that the tastemakers who defined this &quot;queer culture&#39; are apart of these economic groups, and so act as a echo chamber that repeat, amplify, and solidify these experiences and taste because they have the power to do so. But by the end of this video, I don&#39;t know if I have misunderstood anything, or if I have missed anything because there&#39;s no clear, &quot;this is the conclusion&quot;. Obviously it can be more subtle or nuance than that but you get the picture. I like expressing what I learn from your videos to my friends because as someone who is not a sociology student, I find the lessons in your videos Insightful, entertaining, and informative, but I do want to make sure I am expressing your idea&#39;s correctly, and not changing the intended messages of these video essays. For example, I don&#39;t know if one of your messages was that the taste that define the &#39;queer community&#39;, and which come from upper or middle class, are representative of the white upper and middle class or weather these taste seem to be present in the upper and middle class as a whole, regardless of race or ethnicity?",0

He even made fun of the KKK one time and to my knowledge they didn’t even claim to be offended. Think about that, even the KKK wasn’t upset when a black man made an entire skit making fun of then, or if that were we didn’t hear about it. But trans people get mad? It’s a JOKE people... what kind of comedy can exist if making jokes about people is off the table? If someone pointed out to me that the KKK was more “tolerant” of comedic and artistic liberties than the people I identified with I’d say it might be time to do some reevaluation of my peers...

"Wish I could address the Trans Community, he made fun of different races, ethnicities, cultures, women. Even Russell Peters made jokes on disabled people and gay Indians, no one said shit about that. Why do you think that you are better than anyone else, somehow untouchable by an art form that is built on by expressing the darker and comical parts of all peoples. Our flaws unite us, it shouldn&#39;t break us apart. In Jungian Analytic Psychology, it is said that when someone cannot laugh at themselves that that is an indication of insecurity. If you can&#39;t can&#39;t laugh at the darker parts of yourself, then you lack humility, perhaps the greatest of human virtues, something Dave has clearly mastered. Remember, it wasn&#39;t Dave Chappelle who killed that trans-woman, it was the trans community themselves. So, whose the real victim here? I think the trans-community needs to look deeply into themselves, because this is clearly an issue beyond Dave Chappelle or even comedy. You have to learn to love yourself, because no one can doubt that it&#39;s hard to come out of the closet in this patriarchal society and you are a people who have had it probably worst for centuries. There are clearly a lot of trans-generational issues here that need be solved before we start questioning the nature of Comedy, which has has been this way since time and will not bend to your unconscious sense of false-superiority. We are all equal, isn&#39;t equality what you strive for? Then that would mean you should be subject to comedy like all other marginalized communities. Your struggle is no more special than the struggles of mankind throughout history. So, by all due respect, get off your high-horse for once and speak to Dave Chappelle at our level, if you still have the courage to",1

"A little hot take: maybe this &#39;pop obsessed gay&#39; stereotype is male gaze and nostalgia combined?<br><br>I&#39;m a non-binary AMAB who grew up with a Christian conservatory mother and up until plague years I saw myself as this flamboyant gay brazilian boy. But when I was a kid, I was not allowed to watch queer content on the Internet or television. I was kept away from most of it for most of my childhood and yet I really loved pop music. All this performative, flawless, sexy pop girl concept really stuck with me throughout the years and part of me still loves the appeal in a non-sexual way, even though I mostly listen to indie rock nowadays.<br><br>Recently, I was watching a video about &#39;queer time&#39;. It talked about how we, as queer people tend to miss or disregard most of the work-marry-buyhouse-havekids mentality that is forced upon heteronormative society, which in turn makes us feel like we&#39;re not aging. Maybe the way that we consume pop music has to do with this eternal teenage/young adult way of feeling?<br><br>Maybe I&#39;ll edit this later to further elaborate, this was just rambling",0

Our only bonding activities are choosing atypical sexual partners and having metaphorical rocks chucked at us by society, both of which are the lowest hanging of fruit to form any sort of cameraderie around. It&#39;s like shoving everyone who likes icecream in a room together and expecting to get along because they like icecream.<br><br>Frankly it&#39;s kind of astonishing that a group of people who wants to be seen as people silmultaniously is aghast every time the notion that being considered people comes out with the reminder that &quot;people&quot; is a broad umbrella that contains people of wildly different varieties.",0

It&#39;s so interesting! I always concluded that these editorial playlists were made in part with the algorithm? (I&#39;m not that tech savvy lol) But knowing that these playlist are made by actual people makes a lot of more sense now. It&#39;s interesting how Spotify decides to sorta push that detail to the shadows? I mean we as an audience do not have info on the editors. We don&#39;t have that natural moment of drawing a conclusion as when we see the picture of an editor-in-chief of a magazine or read the about the author part of a book.,0
"for the entirety of the first half of the video i was thinking to myself &quot;none of these songs on this playlist appeal to me, i&#39;m more of a punk rock type of person&quot; and i was expecting to not relate to the results of your second survey, and then you went on to say bisexuals were more likely to like punk rock! i feel validated and called out, lol. this was a fantastic video, i love your insight and the new direction in content!",0
"Great video Alexander! I like the new direction of the channel. The international LGBT history in the early 20th century is something I&#39;m ignorant about, your video was super interesting!",0
"This is a super interesting topic because as a lesbian, i HATE the sad girl playlist that’s targeted towards sapphics. There are a few artists and songs on there that i genuinely enjoy but would never lump together like that. It’s just so hard to find sapphic artists who are mainstream who don’t make sad songs about their relationships / someone else",0
"Being from outside north america (but still ostensibly white european, just not the currently prosperous germanic or saxon variety) I wish I could pinpoint this phenomenon so clearly to marketing and capitalism, but I simply can not - because while I clearly see that there is a marketing drive to exploit existing tastes, there is also most importantly, a rich history of gender discourse that pulls gay men into adoration of feminine-coded innocent unseriousness. The answer is CAMP! What does a boy do faced with exclusion by their masculine peers but strong enough to embrace unashamed rejection of such standards... So yeah, where is the discussion of camp on this piece? Aren&#39;t some of these songs just camp? Where is the obvious Susan Sontag reference to tell us about the campness in ballet? What is &quot;fruity&quot; mean but camp? Is it more than just tastemaking, but also attitude - why is a shy gay less &#39;gay&#39;? Why do I dance like a straight guy?<br>In some way, I actually think the most american thesis possible is really the one presented here - to think that capitalism is the tastemaker. Nah. Capitalism is just the selling of a prepackaged recognizable gay signal, which we like because it&#39;s convenient to code eachother, but which we don&#39;t crave because it is incredibly limiting -&gt; camp was never meant to mean gay. But we need to acknowledge that this is our own valuing here, and that broadening our perception of queerness is our responsibility, but also understand that it makes it less recognizable and identifiable and it devalues it as a signifier.",0

As someone with a masters degree in data analytics. I felt you when you said “i ran a logistical regression whatever the hell that is”. Also those regression results…you’re right they were some sexy regression results,0
"Don&#39;t get me wrong, i enjoyed the video and it definitely left me with many interesting ideas to chew on. <br><br>but i feel like this analysis is missing a focus on gender. <br>in our general patriarchal culture, a women liking female artists and &#39;girly&#39; things is normal, but her liking male artists and &#39;manly&#39; things isn&#39;t weird, it&#39;s pretty much just as normal or even socially advantageous. looking up to dudes is fine and neutral for anyone. <br><br>but a man liking female artists and &#39;girly&#39; things is socially mocked and stigmatised. it&#39;s seen as a huge question mark on his masculinity and maleness. liking feminine shit is seen as frivolous and shallow when women do it and ludicrous or even devious when men do it. liking a woman&#39;s art, especially a woman&#39;s highly feminine art, is deeply subversive to the male social role, so only men who are already outside the bounds of excepted male norms - openly gay and/or overtly feminine men - stand to loose nothing further by embracing it. therefore transforming otherwise cishetero normative, incredibly popular female artists into &#39;gay icons&#39; bc of the stand-out visibility of the queer men in their fanbases. <br><br>that&#39;s why Deserved is gay, bc it&#39;s just highlighting popular feminine culture. there isn&#39;t a lesbian equivalent, bc there&#39;s nothing in the world a girl can express admiration for (other than expressly queer content) that queers her gender in the same way. <br><br><br>(i love your channel and you a lot ❤ i&#39;m not hating i just didn&#39;t find the correlation very mysterious to begin with. but i found everything you said to be spot on in explaining why random shit like iced coffee is declared gay culture..)

"I am a Muslim man. I worked with a large group of Gay people and Trans. I never treated a person unfairly or disrespected a person for their way of life, and they are people like you and I. However I believe it is ok to disagree. My book (creed/belief/way of life) disagrees with a gay or a trans. Simultaneously, their book disagrees with mine. Heck they must disagree on both accounts. So it goes. My book disagrees with theirs and vice versa. But we shouldn&#39;t disrespect the person holding the book for holding whichever book. One should not embrace their book to the point where you become a fanatic or an extremist. After all these are books that have existed before our time. You must be yourself aside of your book. A place that isn&#39;t gay, or religious. I expect people to crack jokes on what I believe in. The things I do and do not within applying the book. But we are not our books at the end of the day. After I die people will carry the books. We have to be ourselves and respect one another despite the books. I feel this is a good means of evolving. Disagree and have a chat about it. This too is good.<br><br>Dave Chapelle is genuine. He would not disrespect people. You can tell by his honesty and reasoning for the greater good of humanity. He is one that means well. He disagrees. But he is a good person in or outside of his beliefs. Perhaps it&#39;s the social inequality of &#39;still&#39; being African American yet not American in America - as to why Dave addresses trans and their benefits over others. Perhaps its... well I think that may be it haha. Overall Dave is a comedian. A damn good one. I commend him on his reasoning, and the tool that is his legendary humor. <br><br>I didn&#39;t know who Hannah Gadsby was and wow! I&#39;m watching some of her stuff and she is holding mighty tight to her book. So much so that I dare say that Dave Chapelle would mostlikely save my life if I was racist than Hannah in a life or death situation. Unless I was a girl haha. She just seems like she has a heavy darkness within her. Anywho treat each other good, and ease up ✌🏼",1

What&#39;s also funny is that I don&#39;t get his appeal, despite him as literal gay he is. <br><br>My coming out music was Evanescence funny enough, because my junior high school era was filled with gay confusion because straight bully/classmates often jokingly flirted me for some reason, so the songs I identified with were angry women like Amy Lee, Emilie Autumn, Epica (bonus that I had a bias against &#39;machinemade music&#39;, which was bollocks but I was 14 sue me).

I love linking this to my sociolinguistics class. Like how language is standardized by what the mid-upper class think should be the dominant variant of a language and then therefore make every dialect or variation inherently less than. Except they actually do impose their &quot;taste&quot; for their version of language by teaching it in schools and making grammar and spelling books and dictionaries.,0
"I&#39;ve watched The Closer 3 times and I cannot for the life of me see where he is being derogatory or disrespectful of the trans community. I think the special is one of his best, and obviously if the transgender community is upset, they have not watched it or listened to it in its entirety. Comedians make fun of everyone because that&#39;s the art form. If &quot;comedy&quot; hurts your feelings, then surviving in this brutal world is going to kick your arse.",1

We respect whatever you want to call yourself, but if you take it back to science basics, there’s your answer.",1

"I think a big part of what is considered &quot;gay music&quot; is just what drag queens like to perform (I specified queens instead of kings because there isn&#39;t a codified music genre associated with them yet due to them not being as mainstream). These are songs that play at gay bars, not what loads of gay people listen to on their own. They&#39;re also genres that were popular with POC LGBT+ people decades ago and took time to reach the white LGBT+ tastemakers, so I imagine the average non-tastemaker LGBT+ people have moved on to other genres by now.",0

I&#39;ve always been into niche and weird stuff, at least from a western perspective. My music taste hasn&#39;t changed in the past nearly 11 years since I&#39;ve started listening to VOCALOID music.

I was confused about why dave got so much hate so i had some of my gay and trans friend watch with me and explain how it might be too much for oversensitive people but it was alright for them. It wasnt anything that would really affect them but the others just had to make a big fuss and walk out.,1
"As an aromantic-asexual person, I really liked this for a lot of reasons. The history part with the two different ways queer culture could exist was interesting to me, because even if most gay people I know don’t like ideas of community as much, I didn’t know they used to. Nowadays the idea of physical queer communities is what a lot of aromantic want (without wanting a spouse, a nuclear family unit is far from ideal) because society deems romance as the best human connection. So when aros don’t have that, community and friendship seem very appealing. Also, as most of queer culture is geared towards allo queer people, it’s easy to feel isolated form it. Like queer anthems don’t resonate with me much. Better than straight, but not close to my experience as a queer person.",0

"I’ve never been a huge fan of music that stereotypically is associated and enjoyed by people of my demographic: that being teenage lesbians. I think this might be considered blasphemy but I cannot stand Girl In Red’s music. I think that associating certain interests or tastes with any culture leads to nothing but a feeling of deep alienation and eventual separation, which I would say defines my opinion of the LGBTQ community pretty well. While personally I have a good paying job where I work myself half to death and could probably afford to dress and consume the media that people of my demographic are supposed to be into, I simply do not want to. I don’t relate to the wider culture of queer people my age, as much as used to wish I did, because the wider canon of “gay interests” is just a whole array of things I am absolutely not interested in. These kinds of algorithms seem like the capitalist incarnation of the social alienation that I used to feel, back when I thought forcing myself to have similar interests with queer people my age would give me a sense of belonging and community.",0

As a Black queer nonbinary sapphic watcher over 30, one of the most obvious factors in discussing cultural gayness is whether or not you experienced formative queerness moments pre- or post- social media. All-in-all, though, this was a really cool look at how capital-driven tastemaking works around marginalized cultural identities.",0

"so you’re expecting 240 million Americans to change the way they talk by referring to a person in a plural way which further more confuses the entire conversation because…. Your feelings are hurt?? Am I getting that right? You want the entire American population to reverse everything that they were taught at school since kindergarten by talking like this: “oh yea they helped me” “I can’t remember if it was them” when the conversation is about ONE person. Do you not see how confusing that can be? The first question anyone will ask is wait which people are you talking about. Then you have to sit there and explain that you’re referring to that person as they them. Any normal human with a brain will not be able to get over the sheer stupidity of that attempt to pluralize a person. Couldn’t you people come up with a different word that hasn’t been used in a way for thousands of years? Heck you could’ve used alien, or even made up a word fico for male and fica for woman and even that would’ve been ok. But you expect me to change the way I was taught English because you’re wearing earrings? Furthermore, in your example you don’t even explain to the person you are talking to. You just correct that person by simply saying “they” or “them” as if they will pick up their “mistake”. In conclusion you can’t expect for every person to have the same mindset as you. I’m very knowledgeable in football. But when someone saids “the guy with the ball ran and went to the other end of the field”, I’m not going to get angry and say THE RUNNING BACK!! And shake my shirt at them that as a picture of a running back on it as if that knowledge should be common sense. That’s the problem what your common sense is delusional while another person’s common sense is conclusional.",1
"A man is a man since he was created by God as a man, a woman is a woman since she was created by God as a woman, the problem of these people is in their head and their education. We are present in this time and we exist because the society respected that the man is a man and the woman is a woman and the man married with woman to have children, it is God who taught us since the creation of Adam and Eve.",1
" Gender and biological sex are inseparable. For me gender is the experience of living in the body of a man or woman. In the case of men, living in a male body means, among many other things, dealing with the shame of unwanted erections that every boy has experienced at some point or another in their life. In the case of women, it means living in the body of a woman, fear violence, associating sex with reproduction, and also menstruation. If I decided that &quot;I am a woman&quot; I would be a fake woman because I have no idea of what experience is about. One cannot undone lived experiences so no trans woman can be a woman or trans man a man. <br><br>You say that nobody says that sex and gender are separate. But saying &quot;I am a woman trapped in the body of a man&quot; implies separateness. I can say &quot;I&#39;m trapped in a cave&quot; because me and the cave are two separate entities, but I couldn&#39;t say &quot;my stomach is trapped in my body&quot; because they are all one entity. And that is the case of gender and sex.<br><br>It makes no sense that having trouble accepting their body means that they are the other gender. All it means that they have trouble accepting their body. If I were a short guy and had trouble accepting it, am I now tall?<br><br>Lots of mistakes were made with the issue of homosexuality and one of them was suggesting therapy for gay people so they would &quot;change&quot;. All it took was to realize that it was purely a moral issue of accepting same-sex intimacy as valid, especially male same-sex intimacy. Women&#39;s same-sex intimacy has always been socially accepted. I believe that same-sex intimacy has been self-censored by boys and men because of the possibility of an erection, something women don&#39;t have to worry about. <br><br>But just because &quot;gay people&quot; were wrongly forced into therapy does not mean that people who have trouble with accepting their biological sex don&#39;t need therapy. There is the possibility that some boys want to be girls because they fear the shame of their erection and it bothers them. If you don&#39;t believe me, read &quot;The Sissy Boy Syndrome&quot; by Richard Greene. If I&#39;m short and have trouble with me being short, I would consult a therapist to help me accept my body. <br><br>What I find strange is that &quot;conversion therapies&quot; for sexual orientation are illegal in some countries, yet &quot;conversion therapies&quot; (i.e., transitioning) for gender and celebrated. I find it strange that sexual orientation, with no known biological roots, is fixed for life, yet gender, with powerful biological markers, can be changed at will. If people can say &quot;Today I feel like a woman&quot;, why can&#39;t we say &quot;Today I feel gay but yesterday I was straight&quot;. Bisexuality then doesn&#39;t make sense. <br><br>There are so many anomalies in the gender and sex studies that for philosophers of science like Thomas Kuhn means that the current paradigm is wrong.",1

So you accept that there are biological markers that separate men from women . <br><br>Transgender ideology ( just so that we are clear ) is the belief that , despite the biological markers that separate men from women , an internal belief/ feeling that a person is aligned and identifies with the opposite sex is their true identity .

"People, especially impressionable children, with Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) aka body dysmorphia or gender dysphoria should not have their dysphoria automatically affirmed and promoted. The majority of the time the dysphoria is a manifestation of other deep rooted issues. These people have incredibly low self esteem, often many comorbid mental issues, and no true sense of self or future. If all root issues are solved and the gender dysphoria still exists then it is legitimate. This should take years of therapy properly deconstructing the base causes - certainly not 1 or 2 visits. <br><br>There are many places where children are able to see gender therapists without parental consent. These therapists can prescribe hormone therapy on the first visit also without parental consent. The child patients do not have the cognitive ability to understand the consequences of many things and why age of majority is 18. <br><br>I will never agree with chemical castration of children, double mastectomy in children, bottom surgery in ftm trans children that majority of the time has medical complications, homone therapy/ blockers for children <br> that have not been tested and studied with this type of use. It is extremely experimental and based on the &quot;gender sciences&quot; of John money who clearly abused babies, toddlers, infants and children",1

There are many Christians who do that, but I am not one of those Christians.<br><br>And another thing. The Bible mentions marriage several times, but the only form of marriage that God has ever shown approval of, is the marriage between a man and a woman. “A man shall leave his father and mother, and be joined to his wife.” It doesn’t say a man a shall be joined to his husband, it doesn’t say a woman shall be joined to her wife, it says a man shall be joined to his wife. Any other form of marriage is abominable in God’s eyes. So how could I call myself a Christian if I show blatant approval towards sin?

"It doesn&#39;t make sense, expression is a spectrum but what does that have to do with sex? This is where the problem is, I don&#39;t understand how it has any relation whatsoever, wearing certain clothes, and presenting yourself a certain way has absolutely no correlation with biological sex, the only thing that seemingly links the two areas is the use of the word &quot;gender&quot;. Gender was alway interchangeable with the word sex, why is it now suddenly used interchangeably with the word &quot;expression&quot;? It creates confusion. A biological male should absolutely NOT be able to compete against a biological female determined only on how the male expresses himself.",1
I have a serious problem that some believe it&#39;s ok for a child or young person to take hormone blockers or hormones. It&#39;s a parent&#39;s responsibility to protect their child. A child&#39;s mind is not developed enough to permanently make that type of permanent decision to their body.,1

Subtracting freedoms. You mean like taking away the right to bear arms? Everyone wants to be equal but everyone wants to be special. It&#39;s a &quot;free&quot; country but you want to force people to accept and support a lifestyle they don&#39;t agree with while also exposing their children and if they use their freedom of speech to object they are labeled as transphobic. So basically some people&#39;s freedoms are more important than others.,1

I&#39;m fine with trans women using women&#39;s bathrooms. Millions of trans people use the women&#39;s bathroom everyday with out issue around the world. I&#39;m fine with trans women in women&#39;s jails. Trans women in men&#39;s jails face far more risks than the alternative. I&#39;m glad you prefer empathy and help instead of torture and genocide, but the reality of the situation is that any professional help from a licensed doctor or psychologist is going to involve transition following the WPATH standard of care.

 yeah. Things like finding a middle ground of what is taught in schools and what can be believed as fact by everyone is important. No person should ever be persecuted.

So everybody has to respect their pronouns? Well doesn&#39;t that work both ways? If everyone has to respect their pronouns then they in turn have to respect everyone else&#39;s opinions and views on how they perceive everyone else&#39;s gender. If your male biologically I&#39;m going to call you a guy. If you are a female I&#39;m going to call you a girl. Plain and simple. This trend is getting old. If we never had social media this whole gender dysphoria crap never would have came to be.,1

" you think the transgender suicide rate is caused by people like me and not because of other issues got it.

Seeing this? I believe religion is much more better,0
"In my own personal opinion, I am reading the Quran and studied a lot of Muslim channels on this platform and they all seem have something against the LGBTQ community. So, that being said, would this make you a true Muslim if you are going against the word of God? This is just like being gay and being a Christian, in the Bible, (I can&#39;t remember what verse or what exactly it said), it stated something along the lines of, &quot;those who sleep in the same bed of the same sex, shall be bashed in with stone&quot;. And in order to accept Jesus as your lord you must follow the word of the Bible, or else you won&#39;t be accepted into the gates of heaven (correct me if I&#39;m wrong). Can you really be Christian if you don&#39;t follow the word of the Bible? This same rule applies to Islam; Can you really be a Muslim if you don&#39;t accept the Quran?",1

In fact statistics show that 40% of transgender people have committed suicide upon switching genders. This stuff is more than just skin deep. There is more to this than meets the eye. There is serious gender confusion going on and lying to people and making them believe that all this is ok is the worst thing a Christian can ever do. Coz you&#39;re not only cheating them from a life spent in relationship with God here on earth. You&#39;re also literally sending people to hell. Please look into this. God wants you saved too.",1

In any other context if I claimed to BE something I’m CLEARLY NOT I would be labelled as mentally I’ll.

"In the 1920s people cigarettes companies launched an advertising campaign where they called cigarettes freedom torches. Freedom from what, perhaps in the eye of a young naive audience it would be the freedom from their oppressive and controlling parents. The irony is that if there is one thing that cigarettes take from you, it’s your freedom. Freedom is an ambiguous term that is often used to associates terrible things with noble ideals, as was the case with the advertisement campaign in the 1920’s. You shouldn&#39;t stand up for movement simply because it stands for protecting people freedom, ask yourself the question, freedom from what or to do what. Transgender politics are pushed onto an audience that cannot understand the full implications and consequences associated with becoming transgender. A 5-year-old boy does not understand that when he grows up, he will like women, nor does a 16-year-old understand that when he gets older, he will want a family. Teenagers are not at the level of maturity where they understand the full consequences of their actions, especially regarding sexual decisions. For that reason, it is logical that parents don&#39;t want their children exposed to &quot;educational messages&quot; that promote transgender politics and ideologies. Statistically speaking, 83% of transgender youth contemplate suicided, and 40% attempt it. A movement that claims altruistic motives because it is about protecting people freedoms can’t seem to rationalize why this is, as a whole it experience cognitive dissonance, thus rather than coming to terms with the obvious conclusion that youth should not be exposed to these messages, they define social pressures and negative media representation as the problem, this way they can hold on to their precious beliefs about protecting peoples freedoms, not realizing they are supporting a movement that fundamentally is destroying the lives of youth. Reproduction is one of the deepest drives we have, it shouldn&#39;t come as a surprise to intelligent people that when you strip an individuals ability to have children they fall into a deep depression. Generally speaking, there are two groups of people in society today, those who promote this nonsense, and those who are afraid of the consequences of speaking out against it. Don&#39;t be afraid to speak out, be afraid for your children and your children&#39;s children.",1

His point is is that you cannot change your true gender no matter what even if you have hormones it doesn&#39;t make a difference you cannot ever truly change a gender just because they cut your genitalia off you are still the same only difference is is that they can never ever have kids that are there&#39;s.

" What I find curios is that a supposedly scientist, worried about useless stuff, stops someone from speculating and trying to understand the problems some people have to accept their bodies.

Especially in the field of gender which is far from being resolved. <br><br>I predict that this will go the way of elephant pants. Instead they will find proper therapies for people who are having trouble to avoid ingesting drugs and mutilating their bodies.

It is not trans exclusive, it is male exclusive. Women who identify as men are included in radical feminism. ET also claims that he made derogatory comments about gender...no, he didn&#39;t.

He even made fun of the KKK one time and to my knowledge they didn’t even claim to be offended. Think about that, even the KKK wasn’t upset when a black man made an entire skit making fun of then, or if that were we didn’t hear about it. But trans people get mad? It’s a JOKE people... what kind of comedy can exist if making jokes about people is off the table? If someone pointed out to me that the KKK was more “tolerant” of comedic and artistic liberties than the people I identified with I’d say it might be time to do some reevaluation of my peers...

"Wish I could address the Trans Community, he made fun of different races, ethnicities, cultures, women. Even Russell Peters made jokes on disabled people and gay Indians, no one said shit about that. Why do you think that you are better than anyone else, somehow untouchable by an art form that is built on by expressing the darker and comical parts of all peoples. Our flaws unite us, it shouldn&#39;t break us apart. In Jungian Analytic Psychology, it is said that when someone cannot laugh at themselves that that is an indication of insecurity. If you can&#39;t can&#39;t laugh at the darker parts of yourself, then you lack humility, perhaps the greatest of human virtues, something Dave has clearly mastered. Remember, it wasn&#39;t Dave Chappelle who killed that trans-woman, it was the trans community themselves. So, whose the real victim here? I think the trans-community needs to look deeply into themselves, because this is clearly an issue beyond Dave Chappelle or even comedy. You have to learn to love yourself, because no one can doubt that it&#39;s hard to come out of the closet in this patriarchal society and you are a people who have had it probably worst for centuries. There are clearly a lot of trans-generational issues here that need be solved before we start questioning the nature of Comedy, which has has been this way since time and will not bend to your unconscious sense of false-superiority. We are all equal, isn&#39;t equality what you strive for? Then that would mean you should be subject to comedy like all other marginalized communities. Your struggle is no more special than the struggles of mankind throughout history. So, by all due respect, get off your high-horse for once and speak to Dave Chappelle at our level, if you still have the courage to",1
Dave is just keeping it real and not backing down. Got to give him mad props for that. I&#39;m behind him 100% as he did nothing wrong.,0
I&#39;m getting tired of all of this myself. Y&#39;all heard of the whole commotion about Michael Myers is &quot;homophobic&quot; because he killed a gay couple in the new movie? Smh all of this is getting wild.,1
"Sadly people who are X minority have the minority shield these days.<br><br>In Finland there is super toxic and annoying but really famous gay dude. But if you critise his behavior, he always goes like &quot;Oh you don&#39;t like me only because I&#39;m gay! F off homophobe!&quot;",1
"Jonathan van trash and all those people are sooo blind, they support the LGBTQ community without investigating the other side. Is like they are part of Qanon.",1
Love u Dave chappelle!! Lets go,0
"This has been my experience with a small, but very vocal segment of the Rainbow flag brigade. A lot of them are in int for the sport of piling on others they deem as vile and need to show others how good of a person they are by joining in the piling. I know it had gotten so bad that even gays that I work with despise the Twitter warriors trying to language police everyone.",1
Cross dressing has been known as a sexual fetishist for millenniums. They have taken it a step farther and desire bodies of the opposite sex. It&#39;s sexual perversion and is a choice just like adultery or pedophilia. Sex addictions are stronger than drug addictions.,1

Political correctness is the new form of censorship. It is tyranny with a happy face as a disguise.,0
"Carlin , Mel brooks , John Stewart , Dave Chappell n I’m conservative libertarian I thought liberals were supposed to be about free speech ? And supporting black men lol ironic. Bunch of white liberals trying to silence a free thinking black man , who was using humor to bridge ppl , lol but oh well it’s the world we in",0
Is lbgtq what ever that is go away that’s my right to say that right,1
"Nobody is saying trans people don&#39;t exist and don&#39;t need rights. They obviously exist and they have human rights, like every other human. The conversation is about whether a trans woman is a biological woman. And no, he is not. He is a biological man. So there shouldn&#39;t even be a conversation because the science and the facts are clear.",1
"None of us - NONE OF US - need to hurl insults at one another about this debate! Log off of Facebook, go outside and meet some people who are different. Actual people are kind and friendly. We&#39;re all being conditioned to become assholes due to social media.",0
 you know you can get the same sexual sensation through a woman’s poop chute if that’s your thing. I don’t get this sick man on man behavior. Please someone explain it to me.,1
you idiot the father is a transgender which is a woman pretend to be a man the woman is a man pretending to be a woman you fool,1
 🤣🤣🤣. There is an English doctor who was sacked because he refused to acknowledge that a man dressed as a women in her full facial beard and blond wig was a woman . These are not political talking points or arguments . They are real examples and there are many more .,1

"Stop bullying Chapelle, racists are evil.",0
"I wonder how many of those who protest have actually watched the whole show. All the fuss made me curious, so I watched it -- from beginning to end. And that&#39;s called being objective. And Dave Chappelle made me understand and appreciate trans people more. And now I hear some people will decide for me, for us, what I, what we, should watch?!",0
Where does this world goes.?I see a lot of women than men around the globe and every woman need a man so if man changed to a women then what next..??😢😢,1
" you’ll find that a lot of people who support the trans ideology haven’t ventured much out of their bubble, most would probably had an aneurysm if they went to Thailand, China, Russia or any Asian or African nation and had to deal with biological fact for once",1
Why are the lgbt community mad? All dave said was facts,1
If my son wanted to be a girl I would disown him that&#39;s ridiculous be what God made you to be that&#39;s what&#39;s wrong with this world everybody want to play God.,1

As a moral person, I don&#39;t stand for the perpetuation of prejudice and the harming of innocent people. You still need an education. And you need some morals too. Freak.",1
"This gave me more on his opinions. Now that I have more info, I definitely support this man.",0
NOT BACKING DOWN,0
"I&#39;m not saying the toxic side of the lgbt community did nothing wrong, it&#39;s just toxicity is like an illness that spread the more you&#39;re exposed to it, the homophobes are being toxic to the community and the community retaliates with toxicity also and it just became cesspool of toxicity between two sides, they think they&#39;re better because they&#39;re being oppressed when in reality they became the oppressor in trying to defend their side, treat others how you wanted be treated not how they treat you",1
You have no more right to be against these other gender group. You will get cancelled or misinterpreted.,0
clowns can&#39;t cancel Chapelle.,0
These protesters are just making it hard for the trans that just want a normal life and aren&#39;t offended by everything....I support the trans community but not these frauds,1
"All these butterflies coming out talking about how they support Dave, lets be real people, 99% are coming out because Dave is hotter than ever with the media and they just trying to ride with the wave of fame. We know how fake most of you are, as fake as the hundreds of sex identities. PLZ. You don&#39;t need to be comedian to see the joke: LGBTQ AND THE REST OF THE ALPHABET IN ADDITION to + - next the division sign and multiplication sign lol lol lol lol",1
I&#39;m a gay man and I am having a hard time understanding what did he say that was offensive? Dave&#39;s jokes when they were talking of black people they were never offensive or other groups why is this outrage? If we are saying this group cannot be talked about because they are trans if this is not hate filled and we are talking in the context of comedy all of us are equal opportunity in this setting,0
I personally thought his jokes were funny. Plus they were facts,0
Male or female. That&#39;s it. Can&#39;t change it. <br><br>One more time. YOU CANNOT CHANGE THAT.,1
"He had a transgender friend that came to all his shows and wanted to be like him, which long story short was bullied into suicide by their own transgender community lmao",1
Dave will NOT be canceled!!!,0
The LGBTQ community is being used by corporations the way the black community is being used by Democrats.,1
The great George Carlin lives on Dave’s spirit,0
" simple fact that when i was neutral, i kept getting this &quot;support pride&quot; stuff mashed into my face, which upset me. Then i get annoyed a few times then irl someone is like &quot;you need to support lgbt you know how many friends of yours are in it and dont wanna tell you&quot; like did i ask??? And so honestly being annoyed by it and ppl tryna force me to support it made me go the other way to actually despise it. Toxicity from the community now doesn&#39;t help. They&#39;d rather kill you for not supporting than try to improve on their side.",1
No one is off limits in comedy. Period,0
Everyone is so pressed over his jokes like dude it&#39;s just jokes man he&#39;s a comedian 🤣 you can&#39;t say anything or do anything in this generation without people getting butthurt,0
"The Bible says God made them (people) male and female. It does not say people can change what they are, or choose what they are. It is absolutely not fair for biological males pretending to be female competing against biological females. Just one example: the women&#39;s world record in the 100m sprint is 10.49. The boy&#39;s HIGH SCHOOL record is 10.00. It just isn&#39;t fair to girls to have biological males rob them of their accomplishments in sports.",1
We got the same crap in uk the<br>BBC undermines free speach and democracy. Its become part <br>Of the deep state and like Disney <br>Should be disbanded. LGBTBLM <br>SELF SERVING PINKOS .,1
Trans Community please Explain to me what did he say to offend you? First of all before commenting did you actually watched the Netflix Special?,1
Trans women aren’t women If you put two of them next to one another what would be the thing that sticks out????? That ain’t transphobia lol,1
That community wears their feelings on their sleeves. Can’t mention them before they start to cry…,0
" Don&#39;t waste your time talking to them, bro. It&#39;s no use. They don&#39;t care what we saying about LGBTQ+, so we&#39;re just gonna sit down, enjoy our life and let them be whatever they want before go to hell",1
Someone behind the scenes is envious . Dave is the G.O.A.T,0
"I adore Dave exactly because he is not bending down to anything, he is himself through and through no matter what. He is extremely smart and manages to use that along his shows. Also it&#39;s not like he hasn&#39;t mentioned the LGBTQ+ community before, so why are they just now acting up?",1
Every decade have a voice. But a brilliant voice owns decades. Chappell is a beast 💯,0
But they want a bizillian genders and spectrums and wanna identify as tadpoles nowadays. Like at this point their fairy tales shouldn’t conflict with facts and reality. It actually does harm to society as a whole. We need to understand biology and anatomy.,1
This is true black leadership. A man able to shift culture. Intense.,0
"The act of homosexuality….is it worth it? <br> The gender of a person is determined the moment of birth by the on-duty gynecologist. A preference for liking the same gender is a personal preference and the change of genital organs by invasive surgery does not change a person’s gender it only changes a person’s appearance!<br> The act of homosexuality is not an “innocent” sexual preference, is an act that is disgraceful and countermand to the Law and the Commandments of God. The answer that is crystal clear is not given by philosophy or sociology but by the Word of God, the Holy Bible. The Holy Bible is not an invention of the mind of man, it is Revelation from God.<br>The act of homosexuality introduces men and women into the spiritual realm of ~lawfully belonging to the devil~ because of disobedience to the commandments of God , the same way obedience to Christian Baptism as delivered by the Holy Spirit 2000 years ago introduces men and women to a spiritual realm of lawfully uniting with God! <br> New Testament<br>[1 Corinthians 6:9] 9 Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God?

Nothing is different about these people other than they just changed clothes and he is called she and she is called he and she got a male hair cut other than that there is but a straight couple pretending to be transgender and we the public is suppose to fall for this farce it is so damn stupid and I have no respect for ABC news or any news out let they are pushing the transgender agenda what a big Joke.,1
" If you are Muslimin you should definitely not be watching this stuff , Christians , Jews and Muslims all prohibit such things .

All humans of good character deserve to live their lives.  We don&#39;t choose our gender among other characteristics.  But to cancel individuals or groups who poke fun or critique cultural mores is counterproductive.  We respect you, Dave, for your integrity as a comedian and likely for your humanity.",0
"Wait a second… I am confused.. if someone speaks  their mind in humor, no one can joke anymore at all? I don’t get it! Why can’t we just be people?",0

I hate when they say our children don’t look at us as transgender well it’s unfair to compare their perspective from an adult of course the kids don’t see you as trans they’re fucking kids they don’t know what that is. And of course they conceived he’s a girl she’s a man duh 2+2=4,1

" I live in pakistan too but we see things differently,i don&#39;t think it came from indian culture,they just don&#39;t feel that they were born with a right body and they have the full right to live as they want,if you watch the video carefully you will realize that when they are not on the street they act like any other human being so it is just a scheme to get money(so they have to overreact i guess).I think when they will get proper jobs they will not fully put that much make up like i said before just a money making scheme.Keep in mind that they don&#39;t look as much as a women because they didn&#39;t get the proper harmones and surgeries to make them really look like a women.For example,look at chahat(as well as others) when she was talking to the interviewer she was talking normally.So in short getting a proper job will eventually change that because they don&#39;t have to over do it to get money from begging.<br><br>I am atheist(ex-muslim) too and you are right there are not specific hadith or verses about transgenders but if gays,lesbians and bisexuals are going to hell than i don&#39;t think &quot;allah&quot; will make a exception for trans people.",1

What do you do when you find out they’re trans suddenly start calling her a him? The logic is just dumb I’m sorry. These people don’t go through life shoving their biology and their choices in your face so why treat them different from anybody else? And I’m sorry children don’t give a fuck about it just what you teach them. I think raising children to be nonbinary is retarded but teaching them that others have choices isnt.",1

Oh good grief! There’s nothing offensive there. Anything that mentions that community is put on the front page to bring attention to themselves. Personally I don’t really care how they feel. I guarantee you that they don’t care how I feel. I am full of love and don’t judge anyone. It’s not my place. You know the old saying “fu** them if they can’t take a joke.”,0

Of course, human beings have various psychological traits and preferences all expressed in a myriad of combinations and different extents etc. A man may prefer and display many which can be described as &#39;feminine&#39; and vice versa. But a woman is an adult human female and a man is an adult human male even if they swap wardrobes and hairdos and have surgery or drug alterations. That is not a choice.",1
Shut up it’s a damn joke! So comedy is dead ?,0

when dat bearded dude has a higher voice than my 9 year old niece...wtf,0
 HAYES huh? How is what i am saying in any way contradicting what you say? I mean there is biological gender which the same as sex. Then there is psychological or chosen/assumed gender. You seem to miss the point that not every woman who is psychologically a woman (despite having a penis) is able to be sexually attracted to female genitalia (despite them belonging to a human identifying as male). In this case they are able to be sexually aroused by each other despite their sexual organs not matching their identity which makes this couple unique and complex. Care to explain what exactly is wrong with my statements?,1
Majority of the world doesn&#39;t want these kind of people prancing around spreading their ways. It&#39;s not normal. Oh and I&#39;m only 10.,1
His standup highlighted how close minded some of the trans communty are. Something they should know all about,1
The community and Chappell have no beef. So when we gonna realize we’re being played to fight against each other??,0
Why are we letting these people makes our society&#39;s rules?? Their interest do not reflect the interests of the majority of people it makes absolutely no sense,0
 Head I get called dude all the time but I&#39;m not offended by it because I know I&#39;m a girl and I don&#39;t need to convince myself or anyone else by acting like one because there&#39;s nothing I need to prove that&#39;s the issue you&#39;re trying to say what&#39;s not real is real that&#39;s mentally unhealthy that&#39;s why these people still face poor outcomes,1
Why are all theses gay people getting but hurt,1
 Discoveries I just don’t want ass holes like you infecting our children. And I have given the exact way you think about gender so you calling it wrong contradicts You,1
I&#39;m gay and I don&#39;t understand this. At all....if your a man that wants to be a woman and be with a man why would you marry a lesbian,1
So Tyson ignores reality to... Wonder if he also thinks hormones and things don&#39;t effect depression and well-being as the same ones claiming that use them to make people feel ok in a body that would get sick and/or die if they ever stop taking hormones that could also possibly kill them.... <br><br>But no it doesn&#39;t effect things like they thought right.... So why they still use it then..,1

They like making problems out of nowhere. love giving criticism but never taking any. Honestly how they act doesn&#39;t tell me they should be respected. How they act makes me want to look down upon them. On top of it all some of its members make out their sexuality to be their entire life which labels them as boring And pathetic to me. I honestly don&#39;t give a shit about your orientation all I care about is your character,1
I&#39;m sorry but I cannot feel nothing for these men these are grown men who pretend like their victims when they should be taking on the responsibilities as being Men role models for society instead they want to make it look like the world owed them something so they choose to be girls dresses and wigs and s*** they are disgusting there are there a lost the confused and they need help I&#39;m not feeling the cater to know grown ass men who walk around and address to my heat help you need a whoop his ass and let him know he&#39;s a man,1
I&#39;ve watched every one of his Netflix specials assholes and if you really listen to what he is saying hes not beaten down or coming down on the trans community big he gives it to everybody equally But cancel culture is just stuck on this topic at the moment because it&#39;s a popular one,0
Have these folks just taken out bits and pieces of his latest Netflix special then contextualize it incorrectly. He states why is it &#39;easy&#39; to change gender but difficult for Casius Clay to change his name to Muhammad Ali. The root of this special is race inequality...,0

Well &quot;he is just being himself&quot;, &quot;they are being too sensitive&quot;.<br><br>What is wrong for one is wrong for all.

&quot;if it&#39;s a social construct then why are you using surgery to change it&quot; this is a perfect example of why we need to define sex and gender as two seperate things. It does not matter what your beliefs are because obviously she didn&#39;t mean &quot;your physical body is a social construct&quot;. If you use gender and sex as they are defined this confusion wouldn&#39;t happen,1

" do you know what the suicide rates were for blacks during slavery in America? Or Jewish people in the Holocaust? They were well below the suicide rates of transgender people and you think transgender people are oppressed? Moron. Biologically, Lia Thomas is male. She has a physical advantage over biological females having gone through puberty as a male. That is a fact. Men are stronger, faster, more explosive, bigger hearts, bigger lungs, smaller hips. Men have every advantage athletically and it&#39;s doesn&#39;t matter how you identify. Biology is all that matters when it comes to sports that are physical. <br><br>So what about what I&#39;ve said is inaccurate? What about what I&#39;ve said is transphobic?",1

"It&#39;s a shame, Dave is a &quot;tells it like it is&quot; comedian. Interspersing moments of sincerity and observation between jokes. It&#39;s incredibly effective when it works, but falls flat when the &quot;truths&quot; are out of touch which is what happened here.",0

So if a man...who is 6ft 9 inches tall...weighs about 265lbs...suddenly decides that he feels like a female and has maybe taken hormone replacement sessions for roughly for 1 week*(Say 1 hormone replacement session)...then according to Tyson here...it&#39;s all good? If a hardcore powerlifter who can literally flip a Prius over with a backhand suddenly feels &quot;Saucy&quot; and says he&#39;s a woman...can &quot;she&quot; take the medal or trophy from the young woman who has been training for 8-10 years?,1
"It really annoys me how so many people say that he&#39;s being problematic because he keeps making trans jokes. The reason he does is because he makes fun of LITERALLY everyone. Hes made jokes about black people, Chinese people, Mexican people, and especially white people. The point is this dude makes fun of actually everybody, and the only reason he brought it up more in his most recent special is because trans people are the most outraged about it.",1
"As an LGBTQ PERSON, I heavily dislike the community we have created, and I deeply apologize on behalf of the community, I agree with your opinion! :)<br><br>Being part of the LGBTQ doesn’t give you a right to be toxic, using that as an excuse is the most Karen bullshit I’ve ever heard..",1

"Yeah, it is classified as a disorder. But that does not mean that it isn&#39;t a sex. This is because their disorder cannot classify them into male or female sex therefor they are their own type of sex known as intersex.",1
It’s one thing to feel this way and live your life as a woman when you were born male but putting these people on hormones and allowing doctors to perform surgeries is inhumane. At the end of the day God doesn’t make mistakes but he does allow you to choose. Choose to dress and act the way you want but stop destroying your bodies. Most people do it for the attention in all reality. Because that’s what our society has taught people the more different you are the more money you’ll make and definitely the more attention you will get…..,1
"When people are actually homophobic, it’s really mean. When the person isn’t homophobic, it’s mean to use homophobic as a defence mechanism.

"You&#39;re correct. He just has the appearance of a woman now, but is still a man. Born a man, you&#39;ll die a man. Mental Illness is awful.",1

"It was disgusting listening to Tyson obfuscate battling the straw man that he made up referring to individual self-expression, which has nothing to do with biological science and facts of reality which he was unwilling to verify. Gender comes from genetics, that has nothing to do with how you feel or how you express yourself. It is impossible to change your biological gender, your genetics.

"Rapid onset gender dysphoria is not a recognized medical term because it comes from junk science. The researcher posted a questionnaire for parents on anti trans websites. It doesn&#39;t get more biased than that. Meanwhile, there are actually a multitude of studies in actual medical journals that show the benefits of transgender healthcare for adults and minors. The fact that he ignores all of that and wholeheartedly believes in a term he has not researched shows he doesn&#39;t actually care about the science, he just wants to confirm his own bias.",1

"I am a Muslim man. I worked with a large group of Gay people and Trans. I never treated a person unfairly or disrespected a person for their way of life, and they are people like you and I. However I believe it is ok to disagree. My book (creed/belief/way of life) disagrees with a gay or a trans. Simultaneously, their book disagrees with mine. Heck they must disagree on both accounts. So it goes. My book disagrees with theirs and vice versa. But we shouldn&#39;t disrespect the person holding the book for holding whichever book. One should not embrace their book to the point where you become a fanatic or an extremist. After all these are books that have existed before our time. You must be yourself aside of your book. A place that isn&#39;t gay, or religious. I expect people to crack jokes on what I believe in. The things I do and do not within applying the book. But we are not our books at the end of the day. After I die people will carry the books. We have to be ourselves and respect one another despite the books. I feel this is a good means of evolving. Disagree and have a chat about it. This too is good.<br><br>Dave Chapelle is genuine. He would not disrespect people. You can tell by his honesty and reasoning for the greater good of humanity. He is one that means well. He disagrees. But he is a good person in or outside of his beliefs. Perhaps it&#39;s the social inequality of &#39;still&#39; being African American yet not American in America - as to why Dave addresses trans and their benefits over others. Perhaps its... well I think that may be it haha. Overall Dave is a comedian. A damn good one. I commend him on his reasoning, and the tool that is his legendary humor. <br><br>I didn&#39;t know who Hannah Gadsby was and wow! I&#39;m watching some of her stuff and she is holding mighty tight to her book. So much so that I dare say that Dave Chapelle would mostlikely save my life if I was racist than Hannah in a life or death situation. Unless I was a girl haha. She just seems like she has a heavy darkness within her. Anywho treat each other good, and ease up ✌🏼",1

Even as a little girl I thought I was a girl.

As a gay guy I totally agree. Never liked the lgbtq community or even the idea of it. Like just shut the hell up and be gay it’s not a big deal and doesn’t need to be brought up all the time. And it should not be your whole personality.,1
LGBT backer here. Dave Chappelle seems more open and honest about these issues than any corporate puppet. I&#39;d have a drink with him anyday. You &quot;woke&quot; people need to step out of your goddamn echo-chambers.,0

He&#39;s very smart all hes doing is pushing that line you dont cross . to stir his career. Keep his name out there. Some ppl stand on others to keep from sinking..

My only concern is how this going to affect the children. What if he becomes pregnant again and the boys ask their parents why is dad the one whose pregnant?

If a white dude came on stage and started making &#39;jokes&#39; about different ethnicities you&#39;d damn well be right there&#39;d be outrage...why do people expect anything different? When you have to pretend hate speech is &#39;jokes&#39; you&#39;ve already lost.,0
I dislike it because almost every single person I&#39;ve met that what LGBT were complete jerks to me. Also the fact that if you misgender by complete accident they lash out on you expecting you to know it. I just think it&#39;s stupid and they need to straighten up or something.,1

If there are not two biological sexes then how many are there? The mammalian variation that you refer to is incredibly rare and frequently has an environmental reason for it&#39;s presence. There are animals that actually do change there sex, there are female reptiles that can reproduce without a male. That does not mean that a human or a bear or a rhinoceros can do the same.",1

I knew America was in trouble when Ethan Klein (H3H3) started a podcast with Hassan and started trying to cancel people even though he has said and done TONS of shit that would get any main stream entertainer canceled. Reminds me of that speech at the end of the third Star Wars prequel. He went from saying the N word with idubbbz to having a left leaning politically correct podcast.. it seems like if you want to be popular this day in age in any form of entertainment you need to sell your soul and be a fraudulent douche that panders to the softies on the internet. Oh and I’m not political at all. It’s just obnoxious. I miss the old YouTube.,0

And me disagreeing with this does not affect you either. I never have and never will direct hatred towards anyone but that does not mean I have to agree. They knew what they were going to get into when they made that decision, that does not mean every single person on earth has to agree. Especially with children involved, that can cause physiological damage. Before you attack me for disagreeing, maybe you should open your eyes and heart to being more accepting. I do.

That means he&#39;s on the outside now, looking at it all in his rear-view mirror. He&#39;s no longer immersed in the seduction and deception of it all and he knows that. He&#39;s got a clear head now. Through conviction of the Holy Spirit, he was able to see the deathtrap he unwittingly walked into as a young man. He&#39;s accepted the only way out, as offered in love by God through Jesus Christ, and now he&#39;s saved and living like a grateful, saved man. Jesus came to save sinners. This man got saved and now he doesn&#39;t want to sin anymore. That&#39;s the clearest evidence of true salvation I can think of.

As a black woman who has been through a lot based on my gender, race and nationality (when you reside in a country that isn&#39;t your birthday place) I think certain members of society are using their position to bully others and not allow healthy but hard human discussions. Being trans doesn&#39;t mean you loose any self-entitled constructs you may have had before your transition. Women and transwomen should not be at war, but to deny someone&#39;s &#39;human experience&#39; will result in exactly that. It&#39;s provoking to deny sis women their rights to claim their womenhood since its from birth and a hell of an experience/journey. It&#39;s also crass to deny someone&#39;s experience as a trans person since clearly they are having a &quot;human experience&quot; (which is what David said in his show). A trans woman does not have the same experience as a sis woman, what&#39;s wrong with saying that out loud, that we are not the same, but it&#39;s OK we are all having human experiences!",0

"Listen folks, as recently as the late 90&#39;s you could still talk shit about who ever the fuck you wanted as a joke and it was understood by nearly everyone that it was funny. Not only that but you could joke around in a brazenly offensive manner and people would think practically universally that it was hilarious. <br><br>It&#39;s not that 90% of the people in the US don&#39;t remember this. It&#39;s that all forms of media are being used to control people and get them to stop doing this, and 90% of people are just going along with what TV makes them think they are supposed to do without really questioning it, because they are non-confrontational and not deeply introspective. They just go along with society or at least the picture of what society is that gets painted on media. If they talked to more people in person at length about these things they would probably find that they have a really hard time finding anyone that actually agrees with any of this crap.<br><br>Essentially the TV and other media is being used to display a fake picture of society. One where these ideas are accepted fact. Since most people are just clicky types of non-confrontational people that go along with society, it works, and you can control a huge population of people very easily like that. That&#39;s all it is. It&#39;s really that simple people. The media is being used to brainwash people, and it&#39;s working really really well.  So well that you can tell people over and over again that it&#39;s happening and they still don&#39;t believe it.",0
"I respect both of these guys for their professionalism, which is a novel concept these days. Biologically, XX is female and XY is male.

Tyson skirted that question with a redirection to the &quot;fact&quot; that it&#39;s real for the transgender population, which is possibly a case for psychology, but certainly not biology. Nature is simple. Men make it complicated and bastardize something beautiful. I have yet to see a bull waiting for a sex change. But perhaps BtoC is coming.",1

I’m shocked by Tyson’s response here. Based on everything I’ve heard from him he always stuck with science and even laughed and mocked those that go against science “truth”…But here he dances around defending the science of man being man and a woman being a woman? He is afraid to take a stand here using the red herring of defending freedom. Freedom doesn’t define truth. If we try to legislate that the earth is flat and teach that in schools under the guise that I’m free to identify the earth is flat he would be fighting it like crazy.,1

"It is hard for a non trans person to understand right? So how does a man who wants to transition understand what it is to be a women? I used to want to be trans myself but I realized how disrespectful and often sexist it is to actual women to just claim that I am one without really understanding what it means. What even is the purpose of transitioning? Just be yourself, look and act how you want, fuck labels that are only going to limit you even more. Be feminine or masculine and have whatever name you want, but to claim you understand the opposite sex enough to become that gender, seems shortsighted.",1
I realize this seems to be the latest thing that our country is going through the past number of years it’s running rampant but why doesn’t anybody have on their show some of the people who regret the transition and have some counts on how many suicides there are of children whose lives have been changed with this transition forever I will never produce children they will never have children once the surgeries are done this is horrible I know numerous gay people who act like women and are very flamboyant they don’t want to be women and vice versa transgender supposedly is different but even I wanted to be a boy when I was a little girl and then when I grew up I am 100% woman And not manly at all had this been going on then I probably would’ve been a transgender to and then part of the suicide group when I realized what a mistake I made,1

Make videos like these and you create division. Its that simple.",1
It’s confusing to me but it’s there choice my only question is why not go through the change if this is what you were going to do it’s like changing gender then start sleeping with gay people what’s the point just be gay or whatever,1
#GenderIsAFact,1
I am lesbian but I understand and a lot of kids that automatically say they are gay get extremely mad and say some vile sh*t I am sorry you have seen this level of rudeness and I know I’m not a part of it I would like to apologize.,1
Bro every time I think about the community I’m in I just think of an angry twitter person saying the person who shipped boyxgirl is a homophobe extended into 80 paragraphs. (I’m part of the lgbtq community),1
People don&#39;t be fooled look at the like too dislike ratios and the small crowd at Netflix was a joke.,0

"Dave is such a weirdo for this. <br><br>The trans advocates said they reached out to him privately but he declined. <br><br>Obviously we don&#39;t have proof of that, but who gets a private invitation from someone, ignores it, then goes on stage and passive agressively rants about the invite and tries to demonize the person that invited them as some kind of tyrant? <br><br>Dave Chappelle is a grown man. <br><br>He&#39;s acting like an attention starved alt right teenager right now, doubling down on dangerous and edgy rhetoric, and having more fun saying &quot;eff you I won&#39;t do what you tell me&quot; than creating actual content or creating content of any quality (aka does anyone care that Dave is hardly even funny or exceptional insightful about anything anymore? Doesn&#39;t seem like it). <br><br><br>Let his goofy ass run around and play a cancel culture battle of his own imagination, for him and his fans to scream &quot;victory&quot; and &quot;destroyed!&quot; like they like to do any time they gain an inch with their dumbass bigotry and remedial observations, or whenever they &quot;get away with&quot; saying something dangerous or dumb.",0
To be honest I do not like LGBTQ mainly because of a romance reason that happen with me and my girlfriend. Long story short. She became transgender and I became &quot;aromatnic&quot; or what they call it (I don&#39;t understand these stuff i am not used to this.) I do support some people but I just don&#39;t like the community at all,1
"Sure, &quot;cancel&quot; him and see where that gets you solving the real issues that exist for lgbt in the world. Dave isn&#39;t shacked up with any big corporation right now and he&#39;s always going to sell out stadiums no matter what. This is a stalemate, there&#39;s nothing you can do about this really except sit down and talk to the man and understand him and that he is a man good at heart",0
"they work at netflix for crying out loud. its hard to feel bad for them<br>a few years ago he was funny, now everyones crying. get a furking life!",0
"She said they look like a man and a woman so what are they? A man and a woman. They just dont have certain man and woman parts because those parts belong to the original sex/gender you were born into the world with. That&#39;s it. They&#39;re still man and woman just a different form of a biological man and woman. A man is born with certain parts because that&#39;s just what nature intended and a woman is born with certain parts as well called biological parts. Both man and woman are born with estrogen and testosterone just depending on what sex you&#39;re born with for example, if you were born a man, you&#39;ll have more testosterone which develops a man&#39;s type of penis called the penis and if you&#39;re born a woman, youll have more estrogen which creates the woman&#39;s penis called the clitoris and vagina. That&#39;s it. Biological just means certain nature giving parts that belong to which ever sex/gender you came into the human world with. That&#39;s it. Not having a uterus, eggs, etc. doesn&#39;t mean that a trans woman isn&#39;t a woman, it just means that she&#39;s a woman that doesn&#39;t have a uterus. If you take more estrogen you&#39;ll become a woman and if you take more testosterone you&#39;ll become a man just not with biological parts. That&#39;s just the way it is.",1
"Sooo , if I understand it correctly, a man and a woman had a baby. Just goes to show dressing like the opposite sex doesn’t make you the opposite sex.<br>She said it right at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwuRSS2whTg&amp;t=4m26s"">4:26</a>. <br>You ARE having sex with a man with breast implants. <br>If men could be women and women could be men, the “woman” would have given birth... not the “man.” <br>Foh. <br>Jesus.

"To everyone, THIS MAN ISNT REALLY GAY!!! He was never gay. He just thought he was! The whole reason he thought he was gay was because he never really had male affection.

"You are right that this is what Neil thought and attempted to circumvent. That&#39;s true. It is also true that science is not contingent on the motivations of those undertaking scientific enquiry. That is fundamentally anti-scientific and Neal shamed himself. Shapiro acknowledges that people identifying as Trans deserve the same rights as everyone else. His point is that these rights don&#39;t extend to, for example, criminalising language as hate speech and teaching unscientific gender theories as fact to children.",1
"A situation where a moderate can see both sides. I think the question is when your freedom of expression can have real life consequences for children or athletes etc. Or, your group bullies people who don&#39;t agree with or question your non-fact based belief/ideology. You can be anything you want, but you cannot take my job and call me a bigot if I don&#39;t believe your perception of yourself or your group. The same as any religious belief. You are free to believe, but if your beliefs cause you to harm or inspire harm to others (in this case allowing minors to take puberty blockers and get irreversible surgeries), then as a society we have to step in. That&#39;s when facts and science should be used to determine if you can impose your beliefs on others.",1
"im transgender and i was never bothered by dave Chapelle, he’s actually one of my favorite comedians!! And seeing all these extreme lgbtq advocates exaggerate and try to cancel anyone makes me feel so ashamed to be classified with them.

I&#39;m becoming more and more convinced that it&#39;s the controlling elite pushing this controversy. It&#39;s interesting to me that the majority of comments online that I have read are in favor of Chapelle. So who did he really offend? My guess is those whose 50mil he turned down...🤔,0
 well this one time I said that young kids shouldn’t be taught about being gay or such and I got call a homophobe. And i do not hate trans people at all and I’m not a transphobe. But a lot of people that aren’t in the lgbt community get that response and their first impression of us and how we want to push stuff onto people and that you could get canceled for not wanting it.,1
"exactly.... people think the gay life is OK, but its only caused by a LOT of suffering in our youth.. and we know most people don&#39;t understand, so we don&#39;t tell the truth.

It would be better for them to be thrown into the sea with a millstone tied around their neck than to cause one of these little ones to stumble’” (Luke 17:1–2).",1

"Teaching &amp; promoting gender theory in schools is no different than teaching &amp; promoting evangelical Christianity in order to be &quot;inclusive and respectful&quot; to Christians. Why is one not allowed and one pushed so hard? You can believe want to believe, dress how you want to dress, pretend to be what you want to pretend to be. You don&#39;t have the right to force your beliefs on others and demand worship &amp; special treatment. You don&#39;t have the right to demand that we all stop what we&#39;re doing and change our behavior to accommodate your special feelings. I can be respectful of a religious person who believes the earth is only 6,000 years old without being forced to teach that to my kids or believe that myself. So long as trans activists are trying to promote their lifestyle to MY kid, they don&#39;t have my respect or support. Leave me and my kid alone, and I will leave you alone.

"Did you literally just say that humans have the right to disagree but it&#39;s not ok to? I&#39;m over arguing over this when all you want to do is blow this out of proportion over something that frankly does not matter. And there has been evidence, and plenty of it, that this can be harmful to children. Move on! And lastly, changing your gender is a conscious choice someone has to make. I don&#39;t know what is wrong, but you need to do more research. I have done plenty and what you are saying is idiotic, unproven, and downright mind boggling. Being transgender is not natural, you have to take medication to alter your NATURAL hormones, and undergo SURGERY to achieve what you wish. That is the most unnatural thing possible, if it WAS then we&#39;d be able to do it with the will of our mind and change genders ourselves like some animals can achieve. Stop attacking me when I only disagree with their lifestyle and them blasting it all over the news. That does NOT mean I will treat them any differently if I met them in real life. And I am sorry, but just because you are an expert it does NOT mean you will agree. There are plenty of experts in EVERY field imaginable with the SAME DEGREE that have different views. And after reading back through your comment, me disagreeing with them is harmful if they are transgender? ARE YOU KIDDING ME? YOU disagreeing with me right now is harmful if we are looking at it through your eyes. Disagreeing does NOT equal hate. If you think so, then you are part of the problem. Stop for a second and accept that people can have different views. If you can&#39;t then please go see an &#39;expert&#39; yourself. I would NEVER treat them horribly, I disagree with what they chose BUT I can actually be a normal and decent human being and not &quot;be harmful&quot; to them as you put it. It&#39;s funny how you say my opinion is invalid, but your opinion is valid just because you go along with it. This is why I don&#39;t agree with this, people like you have to attack me for this when I simply disagree and that&#39;s it. Stop messaging me, and do some proper research where it isn&#39;t biased.",1

There have been other former women who transitioned to male and look very convincing. I’ve read that they just STOP TAKING THEIR MALE HORMONES SO THEIR PERIODS START UP AGAIN AND THEN PROCEED TO GET PREGNANT LIKE ANY other woman. The former male( who is now the mom) has to probably stop taking female hormones so he can have enough male hormones to be capable of ejaculation with viable sperm .,1
habits are learned and can be relearned. I know straight men that became gay after being raped in jail. Does that mean they were always gay or that they changed because of circumstance. I know women in gay relationships that still do not consider themselves gay but think the person they are with is just different. The logic that sexuality isnt a choice will allow pedifilers an out as to what they prefer sexually.,1

To say that if we actually live in a free country peoples freedom of expression such as identifying as whatever they want shouldn’t concern you at all is False because A free country gives you the right to live however you want but also gives me the right to voice my opinion For example just because calling yourself a potato makes you happy I have the right To remind you of reality and explain to you in a respectful and decent manner that you are not a potato Why? Because factual information always matters above all else No matter who’s feelings get hurt and the truth is gender dysphoria is a Mental Disorder Nothing more and nothing less these people need psychologist Not Surgeons,1
 my religion does not say that soul has any gender. So there is no &quot;inner self identification&quot;. There are times that soul might remember previous birth&#39;s gender.

It costs nothing to affirm someone&#39;s gender and is nothing but respectful. I don&#39;t understand how you can be so ignorant that you think that because someone does something you&#39;re not used to that you need to tell them they&#39;re wrong and need to stop when IT&#39;S THEIR LIFE AND THEY CAN DO WHATEVER THEY WANT. WHY DOES IT MATTER. It&#39;s like your only goal here is to try and prove yourself right and make other people feel like shit.,0

Also, as a biological male, you cannot know how a woman feels because you would need to have lived in a real female body to know that.

"When I was living in Texas, the bible belt area, I was in high school and managed to make friends with the weird click. These are the people that were the outcasts of the area but they are very friendly and accepting. I was super shy and didn&#39;t talk a whole lot for other reasons but they still took me in and I felt like I had a place to be. One of my friends who is bi and I guess the best way to put it fell into the Shaman religion was an A+ student with an open heart of gold. Never saw her get angry and she always know how to talk to people and explain why they are wrong or right. During the end of the year before she finished high school she had plans on being a teacher and one of her teachers (English teacher) said that she would write her a very positive letter for the college she was aiming at. The only time I saw her cry was after she told us what happened... The teacher found out she is a lesbian (she is bi, just not sure if the teacher knew). Once she found out that my friend wasn&#39;t following the bible to the letter decided to scrap the letter (I think she wrote a disapproving letter in fact) then lost her final exam score and tried to fail my friend.<br><br>This was back in 2009 in a place that didn&#39;t accepted people for who they are. Nowadays, instead of having injustice like this you have people on a power trip quick to draw their &quot;you&#39;re the homophobic&quot; instead of understanding. I am bi myself with a pagan background (within my family) and I do try to create distance with people who &quot;support&quot; the LGBTQ group by telling others to kill themselves or that they need to stop their religion because that is at blame or avoid understanding where the person is coming from.

It is currently unknown whether there is a biological basis to the transgender phenomenon.&quot;",1

I hope this ends and people realize where they are going wrong and how this is effecting the society. Peace .,0
"That’s actually the case for most issues and for most people. However, trans people can’t simply “learn” to accept their parts. There’s scientific studies that show an inherent difference between their brain’s sex, and their physical sex at birth. This is the reason most trans people have dysphoria, and that dysphoria still exists even with therapy/counseling to attempting to remove it. (Usually trans ppl get a diagnosis for gender dysphoria from an expert to see if the issue is internal [requiring physical transition] or external [not requiring transition])",0
"You need to realize the moment people stop attacking little boys who are effeminate or little girls who are masculine then they won’t feel the need to .

Is it anything like the &quot;homosexual agenda&quot; -- the term social conservatives used to marginalize gays, deny their legitimacy and to defeat their efforts to obtain full rights under the law?

"I thought the LGBT wanted tolerance not acceptance!? Tolerance and acceptance are two way different things. How did 2% of the population get so much power and control over media, government and even education? Is it possible that the LGBT is being used for a grander scheme? One day in the West, Christians will be persecuted for their faith like many of our brothers and sisters all over the world but they won’t say it’s because we are Christians. They will say we are homophobes, bigots, close minded, and child abusers (for refusing to teach our kids to accept LGBT agendas).",1

" Devil’s Advocate <br>God is perfectly just, and perfectly merciful. Because he is just, he cannot just wave off mankind&#39;s wickedness. That is why he sent Jesus, who was fully God, fully man, and completely without sin, to take on all of the horrible death that we, by birthright and by our own inevitable sins, should suffer. This is why if you call on and believe in Jesus as your savior and Lord, you will be saved. This is God&#39;s perfect plan, that both fulfills the just law, and saves those who will honor him and know that they cannot save themselves, but can only be saved through grace. <br>He not only gave us Jesus who taught many while he was on earth, but he also gave us the Bible, which is his very word, inspired through different authors in an epic story that spans from creation to revelation of the end times, (and is the most historically accurate book ever written by the way), from which you can learn of Him, his character, and his love. Christians aren&#39;t perfect, we don&#39;t even agreed with each other in some things, and there are many who claim to be us when in truth they are not. Thus, I defer my imperfect understanding to God&#39;s perfect word on your previous questions.<br>Romans 9: 14-24 says:<br>What shall we say then? Is there injustice on God&#39;s part? By no means! For he says to Moses, &quot;I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.&quot; So then it depends not on human will or exertion, but on God, who has mercy. For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, &quot;For this very purpose I have raised you up, that I might show my power in you, and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.&quot; So then he has mercy on whomever he wills, and he hardens whomever he wills.<br>You will say to me then, &quot;Why does he still find fault? For who can resist his will?&quot; But who are you, O man, to answer back to God? Will what is molded say to its molder, &quot;Why have you made me like this?&quot; Has the potter no right over the clay, to make out of the same lump one vessel for honorable use and another for dishonorable use? What if God, desiring to show his wrath and to make known his power, has endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction, in order to make known the riches of his glory for vessels of mercy, which he has prepared beforehand for glory- even us whom he has called, not from the Jews only but also from the Gentiles?<br><br>Hear and believe, Jesus came to save you. God does love those who love and seek him, and he works everything out for his plan. Sometimes these things are too awesome for human understanding, but when you are saved he gives you his Holy Spirit, which reveals the truth to you, bits and pieces at a time, and our understanding will be completed when Jesus returns again.<br>You say that it is unfair for Jesus to speak in parables, or for God to harden the very hearts he created, but who are we to judge fairness? I can&#39;t even judge how much I want to eat for breakfast. People can&#39;t even judge what sexual orientation or gender they are. All I know is that whoever goes to hell for eternity, and whoever goes to heaven, God will rule justly. There will be no injustice in his decisions. And if you still think it is unfair, then why don&#39;t you come to the winning side if eternity? God won&#39;t &#39;force&#39; his way into your life, or shove himself down your throat, but I believe he does work through us, as we are called to tell of Him, and he is always ready to receive you.",1

I&#39;m NOT saying to discredit or disrespect gay people for example, no but children find themselves without being forced. You don&#39;t need to jam it down their throats which is basically like grooming. Stop forcing it. Kids go through life to find out what they like and what they don&#39;t like and who to associate with. It&#39;s been like this since the dawn of the human race. This is only anecdotal but I have 3 very close gay friends that are extremely against this whole agenda to push this through schools. It&#39;s not ethical. If your child comes up to you describing that he/she is into the same gender, then you can explain to them as a parent. It&#39;s NOT the job of the damn schools. LEAVE IT OUT.",1

Well I guess even some LGBTQ authors are bigoted to you because even they&#39;re starting to admit this is getting out of control.

That&#39;s the only study ever done about transexuality. Nowadays they try to say it proves it, but it never did and never will.

Democracy, in my humble opinion, is intrinsically linked with free speech. And, koodos to her for defending her values and having the Supreme court to ultimately support or reject her said position. However, I&#39;ve always felt most uncomfortable with having &quot;faith&quot; or &quot;religion&quot; as a main arguement to defend a certain position. whatever that might be. For me, it feels like a cop out, like hiding behind the cloak/cloth of the church. It reminds me of how scientologists have taken the position of religion, in order to be exempt from having to pay taxes. I agree wholeheartedly, with wanting to be heard at the Supreme court level, but, to make the arguement solely based on free speech, instead of having personal religious beliefs brought into the fold. For myself, I think this just muddies the waters and really takes away from the real issue, which is having total freedom to be able to decide for oneself, what one feels comfortable doing in a privately owned business without having the government sticking their big fat woke noses, and forcing their ideologies down private citizen&#39;s throats.

It seems a lot of Republicans can’t see the trees for the forest regarding the transgendered; instead of pushing back on the entire transgender moment they should focus on the two issues above. Like Tyson mentioned, who cares if someone wants to identify as the opposite sex. And asking liberals if a man can get pregnant or for the definition of a women makes the person asking seem a bit backwards in my opinion.

" a lot of trans people die happy with a spouse, friends, family, etc. There is a higher suicide rate amongst them due to the societal view on transgender people, but it’s slow progress to acceptance! Also the skeletal structure thing isn’t true, a lot of skeletons that are dug up can not be accurately depicted as either “man” or “woman” because we aren’t npc’s and it varies from person to person, and is often ambiguous. But even if the skeleton was determined to have more male features, that doesn’t mean the person was biologically male, and even if they were, that doesn’t mean they weren’t trans. Like trans people do not care if there skeleton structure is more like the gender they align with, like what straws are you grasping at for a “gotcha” moment 😂Your points here are mute",0

However, there&#39;s more than just the shape of the sex organ involved, there&#39;s also hormones. Hormones have a profound yet subtle effect on our biology, this is proven, and even alter brain chemistry with mood and mentality shifts. So then, what is a woman &#39;biologically&#39; if every person produces the same hormones as each other, but trans people produce the same level of hormones as the gender they identify as?

 also they have passing privilege meaning kids probably can&#39;t tell unless they specifically said something to them. The whole point of being trans is to look like a cis person. Also as a trans kid I can assure you that kids are more accepting these days. Tbh I tend to get asked out more than most of the guys at my school and everyone knows im trans. Girls nowadays like guys who are in touch with their feelings but also guys that can understand their situation. As humans we tend to seek people that understand us and when you&#39;re an ftm some girls like it because I know exactly how they feel when certain things happen.

I am a spaceship because I think I was born as a spaceship. Hahahaha omg what happened to this world,1
Trans people shouldn’t give a shit that I don’t think they are the gender they say they are…<br>The problem is that when I say that a trans person isn’t the biological gender they pretend to be… that’s conspired being intolerant…,1

You resolved it privately &amp; if H&amp;M said they want private life out of the limelight then why the Oprah Interview? why the podcast? why the Netflix. Live your life privately then. Everyone knows Meghan is narcissistic beyond anything. They describe her for what she truly is. She lies &amp; lies just to get attention, she&#39;s jealous she will never be Kate.

However, if that is the case, then you should definitely find yourself some better representatives, because the ones you have now are giving the impression that all their lives are exclusively built on are their s*xual identity as well as a victimhood narrative. And by shoving this topic down everybody&#39;s throat all the time, you&#39;re probably not gaining a lot of allies either. <br>Oh, and condoning speech police and calling even the mildest criticism &quot;hate speech&quot; and &quot;discrimination&quot; is not helping your cause either, it just re-inforces the prejudice that the LGBT-community is a bunch of intolerant, narcissistic victimhood-cardplayers who are not able to bear a differing opinion.",1
